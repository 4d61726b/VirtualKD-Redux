2007-04-02  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* 5.1.3 released based on revision 2983. STLport-5.1.3 tag created.

2007-03-30  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* build/lib/configure.bat: Restore TARGET_PROC_SUBTYPE definition
	to distinguish between ARM architectures.

2007-03-22  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/config/_msvc.h, _deque.h, _bvector.h: Portage from
	Ulrich Echkardt to EVC 8.

	* doc/README.evc8, README.wince: New documentations about Windows
	CE and EVC 8 from Ulrich Echkardt.

	* doc/evc_workaround.txt, doc/README.evc3, First file merged to the
	second one.

	* stlport/stl/_stlport_version.h: Bump patch level to 3.

2007-03-07  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* src/dll_main.cpp, stlport/stl/_stdexcept_base.h: Change strncpy_s
	invocation to pass _TRUNCATE parameter rather than number of chars
	to put in destination string. Default strncpy_s behavior is not to
	truncate string if necessary but to report the issue throught a handler
	which lead to an application crash if no handler has been set. Thanks
	Bronek Kozicki bug report 1674974.

	* stlport/stl/type_traits.h: Add a default constructor declaration
	in _TpWithState class to make gcc happy when class is instanciated
	with a class with no default constructor.

	* stlport/stl/config/_windows.h: Change definition of
	_STLP_WIN32_VERSION macro. We do not report definition inconsistency
	between WINVER and _WIN32_VERSION anymore, WINVER is prefered.

2007-03-01  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* test/unit/bitset_test.cpp: Add test for the to_string member
	method.

	* stlport/stl/config/_msvc.h, test/unit/locale_test.cpp: Change
	MSVC6 configuration that now defines _STLP_NO_EXPLICIT_FUNCTION_TMPL_ARGS.
	Even if MSVC6 supports explicit specification of function template
	parameters it do not support the explicit specification for
	template methods, unit tests are showing this problem.

	* stlport/stl/type_traits.h, _alloc.h: Small change in stateless
	class detection feature. Introduce _IsStateless helper struct for
	this purpose even if it can only be used with pure class type and
	not with build-in types or enum or union. It avoids MSVC8 warnings.
	
2007-02-25  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* 5.1.2 released based on revision 2937, tag STLport-5.1.2 created.

	* STLport 5.1.1 released based on revision 2919. STLport-5.1.1
	tag created.

2007-02-14  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/config/_intel.h: Configuration fix, Intel compiler
	before 8.1 have problem with template method specialization. Thanks
	Dragan Tubic.

2007-02-09  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* test/unit/locale_test.cpp: Enhance LocaleTest::collate_facet
	test case to reveal a bug in glibc localization portage.

	* src/c_locale_glibc/c_locale_glibc2.c: Fixed _Locale_strcmp
	and _Locale_strcmp and _Locale_strwcmp implementation to take
	into account buffer size, comparison used to always been done on the
	whole input strings up to the termination character.

	* stlport/stl/type_manips.h, test/unit/mvctor_test.cpp,
	type_traits_test.cpp: Remove relation between STLport __true_type and
	__false_type and homonyms ones in libstd++. Add workaround in the 2
	test suite requiring use of those types.

2007-02-08  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_threads.h, src/locale.cpp: Add missing parenthesis
	in some macro checks thanks Jan Echternash bug report 1653966.

	* test/unit/locale_test.cpp: Made LocaleTest::collate_facet test
	really meaningful even if it requires french locale support for
	part of it.

2007-02-01  Petr Ovtchenkov  <complement@users.sourceforge.net>

	* stlport/stl/config/_solaris.h: __LONG_MAX__ defined on
	64-bits SPARCs. Thanks Aleksey Sanin.

	* stlport/stl/_sparc_atomic.h, stlport/stl/_threads.h: fixes
	for modern SPARCs. Thanks Aleksey Sanin.

2007-01-28  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/debug/_deque.h: Fix iterator invalidation in erase
	of an iterator range thanks to Steve Lobasso indirect report (bug
	1645657).

	* test/unit/deque_test.cpp: New test case for deque erase methods.
	
2007-01-19  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_locale.h, src/locale.cpp: Add throw() specification
	on locale default constructor. Add const qualifier on locale::combine
	method. Fixed combine implementation to correctly combine
	*this with other locale instance.

	* src/locale_impl.h: Removed _get_Locale_impl and
	_copy_Nameless_Locale_impl already defined in stlport/stl/_locale.h.

	* src/locale_impl.cpp: In _Locale_impl::insert add check that we
	are working on 2 different facet instances before substitution.

	* test/unit/locale_test.cpp: Add test case for locale::combine
	method.

2007-01-12  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* c_locale.h, c_locale_dummy.c, c_locale_glibc.c, c_locale_glibc2.c,
	c_locale_win32.c: Creation of 2 new functions in the localization
	framework _Locale_init and _Locale_final to allow localization
	implementations to initialize and release any necessary resources.

	* src/iostream.cpp: Call _Locale_init during io streams initialization
	and _Locale_final at end.

	* c_locale_win32/c_locale_win32.c: Add synchronization for locale
	lcid look up from name required in multithreaded environment. Two
	threads instanciating two facet instances from a given name might
	have collide resulting in an undefined behavior. Critical section
	used for synchronization is initialized in _Locale_init and freed
	in _Locale_final.

	* c_locale_win32/c_locale_win32.c: Add several fields in
	_Locale_time struct to avoid use of static buffers in some locale
	support functions like _Locale_d_t_fmt _Locale_long_d_t_fmt...
	Moreover time format cannot be truncated anymore.

	* stlport/stl/config/_windows.h: Introduce _STLP_WIN32_VERSION
	macro set to WINVER or _WIN32_WINDOWS value depending on what
	macro is defined.

	* stlport/stl/_threads.h, src/locale.cpp: Add _STLP_WIN32_VERSION

	inclusion of winbase.h and windows.h.

2006-11-24  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

        * stlport/stl/_fstream.h, src/fstream.cpp, iostream.cpp: Restore
        computation of the system dependant page size that was hardcoded
        to 4096. Initialisation code has been moved to a static method
        called just after Standard iostream initialisation. This code used
        to be in the _Filebuf_base constructor that might have been called
        simultaneously by several threads.

2006-11-17  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/config/_macosx.h: Add endianess configuration.

2006-11-16  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	missing mbstate_t definition.

2006-11-07  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_threads.h: Removed _Atomic_swap_struct export
	that should be useless as completely inlined. Moreover it was
	generating a compilation error using MSVC 2005 under Windows
	64 bits.

2006-10-26  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* test/unit/codecvt_test.cpp: Removed try/catch blocks not
	supported by platform missing exception support and moreover
	useless as we know the code called in the try and this code
	do not throw (thanks Michael Fink report).

	* build/Makefiles/nmake/targetdirs.mak, lib/clean.mak, app/clean.mak:
	Complete clobber and distclean rules to really clean all generated
	stuffs.

	* build/Makefiles/nmake/top.mak: Patch from Gary Bartlett to make nmake
	'all' rule the default rule.

2006-10-25  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* src/dll_main.cpp: Fix syntax error '>>' rather than '> >' in
	a _STLP_alloc_proxy explicit instanciation.

	* stlport/stl/_unordered_set.h: Fix template method for the
	associative container extension, use _KT type rather than key_type.

2006-10-20  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/config: Removed some used macros
	  _STLP_AUTOMATIC_TYPE_TRAITS
	  _STLP_UNINITIALIZABLE_PRIVATE
	  _STLP_STATIC_ARRAY_BUG
	  _STLP_FULL_ADL_IMPLEMENTED

	* test/unit/codecvt_test.cpp: Ignore test when
	_STLP_NO_MEMBER_TEMPLATES defined.

2006-10-20  Petr Ovtchenkov  <complement@users.sourceforge.net>

	* stlport/stl/_cwchar.h: fix HP-UX problem with WCHAR_MIN, WCHAR_MAX
	[Boris Gubenko].

2006-10-19  Petr Ovtchenkov  <complement@users.sourceforge.net>

	* test/unit/sstream_test.cpp: check bugreport #1580020, not confirmed.

2006-10-17  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_cwchar.h: Restore code to define potentially missing
	WCHAR_MIN, WCHAR_MAX macros. It used to be in _mbstate_t.h but was
	missing some native includes to work, in _cwchar.h everything should
	be fine.

	* test/unit/codecvt_test.cpp: Fix C cast that was losing const
	qualifier.

	* stlport/stl/_mbstate_t.h: Avoid definition of _STLP_NO_MBSTATE_T when
	using own mbstate_t definition in _STLP_USE_NO_IOSTREAMS mode. This macro
	is not supported anymore and should be fixed or removed in future version.
	Own mbstate_t will be defined even in no iostreams mode.

	* stlport/stl/config/_evc.h: Now that mbstate_t situation is clear EVC3
	defines _STLP_NO_NATIVE_MBSTATE_T rather than directly defining it in
	the config file. 

	* test/unit: Several fixes to build with _STLP_NO_EXTENSIONS and
	_STLP_NO_ANACHRONISMS.

2006-10-16  Petr Ovtchenkov  <complement@users.sourceforge.net>

	* stlport/stl/_mbstate_t.h: this header may be included from system
	stddef.h, without wchar.h---defines of wchar limits isn't good place
	here [WCHAR_MAX, etc.].

	* test/unit/cwchar.cpp: correct test to hilight problem above.

2006-10-14  Petr Ovtchenkov  <complement@users.sourceforge.net>

	* test/unit/cwchar.cpp, build/test/unit/Makefile.inc: test a few macros
	related to wchar. Inspired by problems in STLPORT_5_1 and boost::regex.

2006-10-12  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_numpunct.h, src/numpunct.cpp: numpunct facet _M_truename
	_M_falsename and _M_grouping are not static anymore. This seems useless
	and moreover was introducing static initialisation order and threading
	issues.

	* stlport/stl/c_locale.h, _mbstate_t.h, src/c_locale.h, c_locale.c:
	New mbstate_t policy. When no mbstate_t in native library STLport defines
	one for its own need in localisation support. This mbstate_t is simply
	an int defined in global namespace and imported to STLport namespace.
	Internal localisation framework is nt anymore in STLport namespace but
	in the global one as it is normaly a C framework.

	* stlport/stl/config/_bc.h: Defines _STLP_NO_NATIVE_MBSTATE_T rather
	than internal _STLP_USE_OWN_MBSTATE_T macro.

	* stlport/stl/config/_evc.h: Add comment for EVC3 users, this platform
	should define _STLP_NO_NATIVE_MBSTATE_T, but I have not the platform
	to check...

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/bcc.mak: Do not force anymore built of C sources
	as C++.

	* test/unit/string_test.cpp, istmit_test.cpp: Fixed macro checks to make
	tests buildable even when _STLP_NO_IOSTREAMS is defined.

2006-10-09  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* test/unit/codecvt_test.cpp: Fix use of mbstate_t to make it more
	portable.

2006-10-06  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_alloc.h, _alloc.c: Fixed __debug_alloc implementation
	to avoid unjustified assertion about wrong size of buffer to
	deallocate, thanks David Deakins and verntx on sourceforge.

	* test/unit/vector_test.cpp: Add test for bug above.

	* stlport/wchar.h, stl/_cwchar.h, _istream.h, _limits.h, _locale.h,
	_threads.h, char_traits.h, type_traits.h, _mbstate_t.h: Fix regression
	introduce by inclusion of mbstate_t.h in wchar.h. Now _mbstate_t.h is
	only included at end of wchar.h and _cwchar.h. All places where _mbstate_t.h
	was used are now including _cwchar.h.

2006-10-05  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/bcc.mak: Use -P compiler to force build of C
	translation as C++ because of the mbstate_t problem.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/lib/bcc.mak, rules-a.mak: Fix Borland tlib call
	syntax thanks mbkenny.

	* stlport/stl/wchar.h: Add include of internal _mbstate_t.h file to
	know STLport status regarding mbstate_t configuration.

	* stlport/stl/c_locale.h: When building platform localisation support
	as C++ struct declaration are done in STLport namespace.

	* src/c_locale.h: Removed _mbstate_t.h include that is now included
	from wchar.h or _cwchar.h depending on C or C++ build. Removed #error
	done too early (see next comment).

	* src/c_locale.c: Add #error statement when building STLport on a platform
	having real localisation support but no native mbstate_t definition. In this
	case c_locale.c must be built as a C++ translation unit.

	* src/c_locale_win32/c_locale_win32.c: Add Borland workaround to avoid
	compilation error now that it is build as a C++ translation unit.

	* stlport/stl/_mbstate_t.h: Now that this file is not included from outside
	world we can include internal _cwchar.h rather than cwchar. Removed
	a wint_t workaround already existing in _cwchar.h. Removed Borland workaround
	that was defining mbstate_t when using this file in a C context, it was
	moreover different than the definition in C++ ! Ad a pure C declaration of
	mbstate_t when in C.

2006-10-04  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* src/c_locale.h: Add #error to signal issue when building c_locale.c
	as a C source when STLport uses its own mbstate_t definition.

	* src/num_put_float.cpp: Modification in Cygwin native lib headers
	revealed that we were missing ieeefp.h include.

	* src/dll_main.cpp, stlport/stl/_threads.h: Fix export of
	_Atomic_swap_struct for compilers supporting export of templates.

	* stlport/stl/config/_hpacc.h: Some cleanup (unknown _STLP_NO_KOENIG_LOOKUP
	macro) and formating fixes.

	* stlport/stl/_bvector.h: Use _STLP_DECLARE_RANDOM_ACCESS_REVERSE_ITERATORS
	rather than reproducing the workaround hidden by this macro.

	* test/unit/vector_test.cpp: Add test case to check iterators comparisons.

2006-09-26  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* src/allocators.cpp: Reorder code blocks to fix build when using
	_STLP_LEAKS_PEDANTIC.

	* stlport/stl/_num_put.c: Restore __len >= 2 check in
	__copy_integer_and_fill function. It has been removed on the
	2006-07-11, at this time STLport always add the base information
	even for 0 value. This modification has been rollback but not this
	check.

	* test/unit/num_put_get_test.cpp: Add check for above fix.

2006-09-26  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* src/c_locale_win32/c_locale_win32.c: Add check of code page when
	specified in locale name.

	* src/c_locale_win32/c_locale_win32.c: Add checks in __ConvertDate
	and _Locale_t_fmt to avoid potential buffer overflow.

	* src/c_locale_win32/c_locale_win32.c: Create __GetLocaleInfoUsingACP
	function that merge a call to GetLocaleInfoA and a call to
	__ConvertFromACP in one call, the latter function has been removed.

	* src/c_locale.h: Restore _STLP_BEGIN_NAMESPACE when STLport use
	its own mbstate_t definition which is only available in STLport
	namespace. Fix Borland regression.

	* stlport/stl/_mbstate_t.h: Replace stl/_cwchar.h include with
	a cwchar one as this file is included from the outside world when
	building STLport lib.

2006-09-25  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* test/unit/codecvt_test.cpp: New test case for the codecvt
	facet.

	64bits issue warning.

2006-09-21  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/c_locale.h: Patch from Boris Gubenko to avoid
	direct inclusion of internal header from this header that is
	access from the outside world when building STLport lib.

2006-09-20  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* test/unit/allocator_test.cpp: Add new test case for allocation of
	empty buffer.

	* test/unit/fstream_test.cpp: Use a variable to always point to the same
	test file and adopt a 'Standard' file name 'test_file.txt'.

	* stlport/stl/_hash_fun.h: Rollback 2006-08-26 Petr modification that
	was introducing a regression with MSVC compilers.

	* stlport/stl/_fstream.c: First attempt to fix seekoff basic_filebuf
	implementation when dealing with a codecvt facet having variable
	encoding. This fix is surely not complete, discussion with Uli is not
	over.

2006-09-13  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_exception.h: Made a previously general Windows 64 bits
	workaround specific to the cross compiler coming with PSDK. Thanks

	* stlport/stl/_num_put.c: Modification in __do_put_integer to avoid
	a Hp aCC workaround.

2006-09-11  Petr Ovtchenkov  <complement@users.sourceforge.net>

	* stlport/stl/_algo.c: search_n with predicate fail in case
	when subsequence size is 1; thanks Timmie Smith.
	
	* test/unit/alg_test.cpp: test for problem.

2006-09-08  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* src/c_locale_win32/c_locale_win32.c: Modification in __GetLCIDFromName
	to support the Chinese_Taiwan locale. Add of a __GetLCID call when first
	call to it using non NLS mapping fails.

	* src/c_locale_win32/c_locale_win32.c: Change __ParseLocaleString
	implementation to correctly handle locale with a name having '.' in
	the language or country part like in 'Chinese_Hong Kong S.A.R..950'.

2006-09-05  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* build/lib/configure.bat: Fixed comment for --rtl-dynamic and
	--rtl-static options, impact on macros to uncomment in hosts.h
	config file was inversed. Thanks Igor Pavlov.

	* build/lib/configure.bat, doc/FAQ, doc/README.msvc,
	stlport/stl/config/user_config.h, _hpacc.h: Replaced references to
	_site_config.h by hosts.h. Thanks Igor Pavlov.

2006-08-30  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_cmath.h, _cstdlib.h: Patch from Boris Gubenko, Hp aCC
	native Standard	lib already define math functions in global namespace.
	
	* stlport/stl/_num_put.c: Patch from Boris Gubenko, Hp aCC before version
	60000 do not consider 'const ptrdiff_t' as const enough to be used in a
	static buffer declaration.

2006-08-26  Petr Ovtchenkov  <complement@users.sourceforge.net>

	* stlport/stl/_hashtable.c: allow smaller bucket counts for
	hashtable. Thanks Herbert Duerr.

	* stlport/stl/_hash_fun.h: use primary types for hasher, not
	typedefs.

	* stlport/stl/type_manips.h: workaround for __true_type/__false_type
	for various versions gcc (oh, yes, gcc, it's real pain to detect
	real version of libstdc++)
	
2006-08-10  Petr Ovtchenkov  <complement@users.sourceforge.net>

	* stlport/stdlib.h: include errno.h for aCC, in case of -mt option in force.
	This solve errno problem on HP-UX. Thanks Boris Gubenko.

2006-07-22  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/config: Add _STLP_PLATFORM and _STLP_COMPILER repectively
	containing STLport detected platform and compiler names. Some names
	are surely not accurate and will be fixed but introducing those macros,
	especially _STLP_COMPILER, help to report detection issue.

	* stlport/stl/config/_system.h: Change macro checks in order to guaranty
	that only one platform and only one compiler configuration file will be
	included.

	* stlport/stl/config/_cygwin.h, _mingw.h: Added

	* stlport/stl/config/features.h: Removed _STLP_NO_MEMBER_TEMPLATE_CLASSES
	check when _STLP_USE_TEMPLATE_EXPRESSION is activated.

	* stlport/stl/config/_gcc.h, features.h: Add _STLP_NORETURN_FUNCTION
	to signal function not returning, under gcc we use __attribute__((noreturn)). 

	* src/locale_impl.h, stlport/stl/_ios_base.h, _locale.h, _range_errors.h,
	_rope.h, _string_base.h, _vector.h, debug/_debug.h: Add
	_STLP_NORETURN_FUNCTION to function that encapsulate raising of exceptions.
	This help to limit warnings about uninitialized variable before use under
	gcc.

2006-07-18  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* test/unit/unordered_test.cpp: Change Key data type from size_t
	to the more portable int. Fix what seems to be a bad code generation
	of gcc under Linux 64 bits resulting in a test failure.

2006-07-17  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* test/unit/alg_test.cpp: New test for find_first_of algo.

	* stlport/stl/config/user_config.h, features.h: string template
	expressions is not a transparent feature, some compilers (VC6)
	are experimenting ICE with it or some other (gcc) do not accept
	it when extending string class (see mystring in
	test/unit/string_test.cpp). So default STLport configuration will
	be without string template expression, _STLP_DONT_USE_TEMPLATE_EXPRESSION
	has been replaced by _STLP_USE_TEMPLATE_EXPRESSION.

2006-07-16  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* test/unit/mvctor_test.cpp: Patch from Michael Fink to avoid a EVC
	ARM crash.

2006-07-13  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_num_put.c: Rollback modif above, according C printf doc
	0 value shouldn't show their base.

	* stlport/stl/type_traits.h: Avoid instanciation of _IsCVConvertible if
	not dealing with pointers. Systematical instanciation was giving
	compilation error as soon as type had a special memory alignment, such
	types cannot be pass by value in function calls. Thanks andy2222 from
	sourceforge.

	* build/Makefiles/nmake/evc3.mak, evc4.mak, evc8.mak: Patch from Ulrich
	Eckhardt to remove commctrl.lib dependency, for the moment evc3 and evc4
	only contains a note about this potentially useless dependency.

	* stlport/stl/debug/_string.h: Add missing copy methods in the debug
	string implementation thanks Patrick Bennett report.

	* test/unit/string_test.cpp: New copy test case for string::copy.

	* stlport/stl/_algo.h: Add missing _STLP_PRIV namespace scope in calls
	to __find_first_of thanks Patrick Bennett report.

2006-07-11  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/debug/_deque.h, _list.h, _slist.h, _string.h, _vector.h:
	Extend use of _Non_Dbg_iter function in all template methods dealing
	with iterator range.

	* _num_put.c: Fix to show base in octal or hexadecimal mode even for
	0 value.

	* stlport/stl/_istream.c: Avoid modification of value to extract in
	formatted input of short and int when value would overflow.

	* test/unit/num_put_get_test.cpp: Add some tests for above fixes.

	* test/unit/iostream_test.cpp: New tests for general stream
	manipulations.

	* stlport/stl/_istream.h: Fix ws iostream function, it do not set failbit
	anymore when stream is in eof state.

	* build/lib/msvc.mak: Generation of config.mak is not mandatory anymore
	as Intel compiler do not need it for the moment. Only a COMPILER_NAME
	is mandatory which is given by icl.mak for Intel compilers and by
	config.mak for Microsoft ones.
	
2006-07-10  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/debug/_iterator.h: Creation of _Non_Dbg_iter function
	returning native iterator of special debug iterator with
	compilers supporting partial template function ordering. Fix
	a MSVC .Net 2003 issue that seems to be related to a too important
	template depth.

	* stlport/stl/debug/_deque.h, _list.h, _slist.h, _string.h, _vector.h:
	Use new _Non_Dbg_iter function in constructors from iterator
	range.

2006-07-07  Petr Ovtchenkov  <complement@users.sourceforge.net>

	* build/lib/configure: rollback changes 4 Jul 2006 19:42:55,
	it's definitely wrong (phrase with quotes ['] requires double
	quotes ["]).

2006-07-06  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_num_put.c: Small refactoring with introduction
	of the __do_put_integer function for integer types output. Moreover
	static buffer size used for formating is now based on output
	type sizeof.

	* stlport/stl/_ostream.c: Add some assertion before cast to check that
	no significant digit is lost. Add cast to long in int and short output
	in order to make type of expression more explicit and correct. This
	fix the bug report from Geoffrey Bache on sourceforge about output of
	-1 ont value on 64bits linux.

	* test/unit/floatio_test.cpp: Removed, all code moved to NumPutGetTest
	test fixture.

	* test/unit/num_put_get_test.cpp: New, contains all tests regarding
	input/output of numeric values (locale independant).

	* test/unit/locale_test.cpp: locale independant tests of numeric input/
	output moved to NumPutGetTest test fixture.

2006-07-04  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_rope.h, _rope.c: Patch from Peter Hercek to fix a
	missing null termination in rope constructor from a character 
	and a buffer overrun.

	* stlport/stl/_rope.h: Removed special _S_rounded_up implementation
	for other types than char and wchar_t. rope implementation is
	expecting this method to always return a size > to the given size in
	order to store the terminating null character.

	* stlport/stl/_rope.c: Fix reference counter management to avoid memory
	leak in _S_destr_concat_char_iter.

2006-06-30  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* src/num_put.cpp, num_put_float.cpp: Patch from Glen Summers
	to fix float output using locale with grouping and float value
	has no decimal.

	* test/unit/locale_test.cpp: Add some tests showing above bug.

2006-06-29  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_algo.h, _algo.c, _algobase.h, _algobase.c,
	_hashtable.c: Patch from Andriy Syrovenko to fix implementation
	of __equal_range, __lower_bound, __upper_bound when dealing with
	a key whom type is different from the value_type of the iterator.

	* test/unit/equal_test.cpp: Add some tests to show above bug.

2006-06-28  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_string_sum_methods.h, debug/_string_sum_methods.h:
	Small refactoring and simplification of code to avoid a parameter
	with default value. This fixing an ICE using MSVC6.

	* test/unit/string_test.cpp: Ignore the newly introduce te_tmp
	test using MSVC6.

2006-06-27  Petr Ovtchenkov  <complement@users.sourceforge.net>

	* stlport/stl/_list.h: fix bug in list.swap, thanks Viktor Govako.

	* test/unit/list_test.cpp: test for bug above.

2006-06-27  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* build/lib/configure: Add --with-lib_motif option to grant STLport
	users the possibility of tweaking the generated libraries name.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/unix/lib.mak: Add code to take into account
	configured lib motif in generated library name.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/netware/lib.mak: Looks like it needs same
	defines as the ones in cygming/lib.mak so we simply include this
	file.

	* stlport/stl/config/_evc.h: Patch from Michael Fink to fix a
	compilation error.

	* test/unit/cppunit/cppunit_mini.h: Patch from Michael Fink to
	avoid unused parameter warning.

2006-06-23  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_pair.h, _bvector.h, config/_evc.h: Patch from
	Ulrich Eckhardt to extend an evc4 MIPS workaround for eVC8
	and to generalize little endian configuration.

	* DMC patch from Eric Sanford. Define _STLP_NO_FUNTION_TMPL_PARTIAL_ORDER
	so that many ignored unit test could be now passed. Also specify
	Intel 386 instruction set during compilation to limit link errors.

2006-06-22  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_algobase.c: Removed check of equivalent predicate
	commutativity in find algorithm. In this case, equivalence relation
	might have been implemented using a member operator == which is
	not commutative thanks Grisha Spivak report. Other checks that are
	using an explicit predicate parameter has been kept even if it forces
	STLport users to implement commutative functor.

	* test/unit/find_test.cpp: Add test to show above issue.

	* stlport/stl/_hashtable.c: Removed equivalent predicate checks
	that are useless as in _STLP_DEBUG mode the debug wrapping add this
	check in the functor used to instanciate the non debug hashtable
	implementation.

2006-06-19  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* STLport 5.1.0 candidate released. STLPORT_5_1 branch created in
	CVS. Version tagged STLPORT_5_1_RC1.

2006-06-17  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* test/unit/type_traits_test.cpp, uninitialized_test.cpp: Add
	explicit public inheritance relation to avoid an ICL warning.

	* stlport/stl/config/features.h: Add definition of
	_STLP_DEBUG_LEVEL to _STLP_STLPORT_DBG_LEVEL when _STLP_DEBUG
	is defined but _STLP_DEBUG_LEVEL hasn't been set.
	(thanks an ICL warning report)

	* stlport/stl/config/_intel.h: Remove undef of
	_STLP_NO_UNEXPECTED_EXCEPT_SUPPORT, even if the linker complains
	about not finding unexpected_exception it looks like it finally do
	not use it.

	* test/unit/cppunit/test_main.cpp: Filter definition of
	unexpected_exception when building unit test with static STLport
	lib.

2006-06-15  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/config/features.h: Several macro renamed:
	  - _STLP_LONG_DOUBLE  -> _STLP_LONGEST_FLOAT_TYPE
	  - __DFL_TMPL_PARAM -> _STLP_DFL_TMPL_PARAM
	  - __DFL_TYPE_PARAM -> _STLP_DFL_TYPE_PARAM
	  - __DFL_NON_TYPE_PARAM -> _STLP_DFL_NON_TYPE_PARAM
	  __DFL_TYPE_ARG removed.
	
	* stlport/stl: Add char_traits template parameter in all
	istreambuf_iterator and ostreambuf_iterator instanciation where it
	was missing as some compiler might not have supported it.

	* stlport/stl/_time_facets.h, src/locale_impl.cpp: Finaly adopt a
	specific gcc workaround for definition of _Locale_time_extract_hint
	as friend of time_get_byname facet. Gcc 2.95 prefers to see a template
	method otherwise it emits a warning, we want to avoid STLport users
	to have to disable this warning. Other compilers will use a simple
	function which seems to be more portable.

	* stlport/stl/_vector.h, _pair.h: Patch from Eric Sanford for a
	really weird Borland compiler workaround that consists in adding
	a _Ret typedef in __move_traits or __type_traits traits struct
	that do not normally contain it.

	* stlport/stl/config/_bc.h: Borland free compiler do not support
	STLport container extension of template methods.

2006-06-14  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* test/unit: Patch from Ulrich Eckhardt to fix storage of string
	literals to const char* rather than simple char*.

	* build/Makefiles/nmake: Ulrich Eckhardt patch:
	  - /MACHINE:IX86 is obsolete and only supported for backward
	    compatibility as alias for X86. Replaced all cases of IX86
	    with X86.
	  - /NODEFAULTLIB:OLDNAMES.lib seems to also be universal so I
	    moved it to the base, too.
	  - In order to use main() as entry point under CE, use linker 
	    option /ENTRY:mainACRTStartup. This was already done for
	    evc3,4,8 but I moved it to app/evc-common.mak and documented
	    it.

	* stlport/stl/_cmath.h, config/_evc.h: Uli patch to activate long
	double support for EVC and use _hypot to implement STLport
	overload.

	* src/complex.cpp: Remove internal __stlp_hypot that is not necessary
	anymore now that STLport always define a hypot function (thanks Uli
	remark).

	* stlport/stl/config: Ulrich Eckhardt VC8/CE patch:
	  - Adapt the code to construct the paths to the native includes
	    so that it matches the changed structure. This is currently
	    only for ARM and might need more work for other targets (x86
	    works though).
	  - Make a distinction between the desktop and CE variants concerning
	    the exception support functions. These now use the same compiler
	    versions so that can't be used anymore.
	  - MS' safe string functions are not available under CE - I think,
	    need to take a closer look at Platform Builder.

	* stlport/stl: Ulrich Eckhardt to adapt STLport to VC8/CE limited
	native C library.

2006-06-13  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/pointers/_tools.h: Add partial specialization for
	_IteWrapper helper struct so that when type to store and stored
	type are identical input iterators are not wrapped. Otherwise input
	iterators are wrapped to perform necessary casts between pointer type
	and void*.

	* stlport/stl/_cmath.h: Fixed macros definition used to define all
	math functions for compilers supporting long double but not having
	float nor long double C math functions. Thanks Ulrich Eckhardt report.
	
2006-06-12  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* test/unit/set_test.cpp, map_test.cpp: Replace size_t with the
	more portable int type when possible.

	* stlport/stl/pointers/_tools.h: Check that type to store is a
	pointer type before modifying predicate type for set container.
	Wrapping less functor in all cases was making move semantic tests
	to fail as predicate is not then detected as being the STLport
	less predicate.

	* stlport/stl: DMC patch from Eric Sanford. DMC do not like __ss
	variable that is a reserved keyword.

2006-06-11  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* build/Makefiles/nmake: Patch from Ulrich Eckhardt to use
	main rather than WinMain for EVC platform.

	* build/test/unit/gcc.mak: Removed redondant macro definition
	_STLP_USE_STATIC_LIB under cygwin/mingw as those definition
	are part of base make files.

	* stlport/stl/type_manips.h, _hashtable.h: Eric Sanford workaround
	for Borland.

2006-06-09  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* test/unit/cppunit: Patch from Ulrich Eckhardt to
	  - Removed a few superfluous semicolons.
	  - Made some constructors explicit.
	  - Documented the meaning of FileReporter::_myStream.
	  - Reformatted some things to not exceed 100 chars per
	    line or use several expressions/statements in one line.

	* build/Makefiles/nmake: Patch from Ulrich Eckhardt to
	  - adds support for x86 (running on e.g. a PC, so-called CEPC).
	  - adds support for MIPS or more specifically MIPSII, other MIPS
	    subtypes can easily be added.
	  - removes a line "DEFS_COMMON = /D%TARGETCPU%" from the config.mak
	    file generated for MIPS, the same functionality was moved to the
	    CPU-specific setups where it is done for other CPUs.
	  - adds an additional compiler flag so that diagnostics better
	    match what the VC8 IDE expects.

	* stlport/stl: Patch from Ulrich Eckhardt to
	  - removes several unnecessary semicolons (typically, when
	    inlining functions like "void foo() {};" where it in fact doesn't
	    hurt (due to something I consider an oversight in the standard)
	    but also doesn't make sense.
	  - fixes inconsistent indentation in three cases, one with the
	    preprocessor and two with memberfunction bodies.

	* stlport/stl/pointers/_tools.h: Add missing template method
	in _CastTraits helper struct used on compiler with no partial
	template specialization support.

2006-06-08  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/pointers/_tools.h, _set.h: Fix problems reported by
	gcc that seems to do more check that MSVC on explicit
	instanciation of templates. Especially fixed problem introduce
	by STLport extension of set template methods.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/aCC.mak, lib/aCC.mak: Patch from Boris
	Gubenko for Hp aCC build.

2006-06-07  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/pointers: Restore pointer specialization feature.
	Major modifications are:

	- vector specialization is done using a qualified void pointer
	in order to keep optimization oportunities when working on
	pointers. Using a strict void* was forcing wrapping of iterators
	in template method making _BothPtrTypes struct helper failing to
	detect both pointer types.

	- Fixed set specialization thanks to explicit instanciation added
	in ptrspec_test.cpp.

	- Refactoring of algorithm to find storage type from value type.

2006-06-02  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* build/Makefiles/nmake: Patch from Ulrich Eckhardt for
	cleanup. Some script refactoring, wrong OPT_STLDBG_STATIC references
	replaced by OPT_STATIC_STLDBG.

	* src: Patch from Ulrich Eckhardt to cleanup locale implementation
	and fix time facet creation when using dummy locale implementation.

	* stlport/stl/config/_evc.h: Patch from Ulrich Eckhardt to fix
	endianess definition.

	* stlport/stl/debug/_hashtable.h: Create a _DbgEqual functor to
	check correct equivalent predicate implementation. Add also
	missing hash_func and key_eq methods in this mode.

	* stlport/stl/debug/_tree.h: Small refactoring in _DbgCompare
	functor.

	* stlport/stl/type_traits.h, boost_type_traits.h: Restore boost
	support.

2006-06-01  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_tree.h, _set.h, _map.h, debug/_tree.h: Removed
	erase template method extension, might conflict with erase
	overload taking an iterator. User workaround will be to use
	erase(find(key)).

	* stlport/stl/_hashtable.h, _map.h, _set.h, _unordered_set.h,
	_unordered_map.h, debug/_hastable.h: Add template methods extension.

	* stlport/stl/config/features.h: Add management of containers template
	method extension.

	* stlport/stl/config/_apple.h, _symantec.h: Config update based on
	config that used to be in _tree.h and _hashtable.h to remove
	container template methods extensions.

2006-05-31  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/config/_evc.h: Patch from Michael Fink to add ptrdiff_t
	definition and forbid use of _STLP_DEBUG mode for evc 3/4 on ARM.

	* build: Ulrich Eckhardt patch for Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 for
	Embedded C++ portage.

2006-05-30  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/type_traits.h: Rename _Is_Integer<_Tp>::_Integral and
	_Is_Rational<_Tp>::_Rational in respectively _IsIntegral<_Tp>::_Ret
	and _IsRational<_Tp>::_Ret for naming convention coherency.

	* stlport/stl/type_traits.h: Add _TrivialNativeTypeCopy helper to
	handle a number of oportunities to use memcpy/memmove in
	uninitialized_* or copy algorithms that was not cover by simply
	checking type_traits has_trivial* features.

	* stlport/stl/type_traits.h, boost_type_traits.h: Refactor _BothPtrType
	implementation, only one version is necessary as it uses _IsPtr that
	has a variable implementation depending on config.

	* stlport/stl/_vector.h: Add _DefaultZeroValue specialization for
	vector container so that a vector of vector is simply initialized
	using a memset to set everything to 0.

	* test/unit/vector_test.cpp: Add check that previous optimization
	works as expected.

	* stlport/typeinfo.h: Borland patch from Eric Sanford.

	* DMC patch from Eric Sanford

	* stlport/stl/debug/_tree.h: Patch from Ulrich Eckhardt to add missing
	count template method.

	* src/dll_main.cpp: Patch from Ulrich Eckhardt to fix strncpy
	usage.

2006-05-23  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_deque.h, _deque.c: Change implementation to use
	_TrivialInit new feature.

	* stlport/stl/boost_type_traits.h: Add _TrivialInit implementation
	using boost type traits.

2006-05-22  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/type_traits.h: Add _TrivialInit helper struct to
	report if a type is trivial to initialize or not that is to say
	if the type has a trivial default constructor. Handle native types
	exception that are consider as having a trivial default constructor
	but that required a 0 initialization on explicit constructor
	call.

	* stlport/stl/_uninitialize.h: Add a helper function
	__uninitialize_init that result in a no-op if _TrivialInit returns
	__true_type.

	* stlport/stl/_vector.h: Modification of vector constructor to
	destect when it is called without an explicit default value so
	that we can call __uninitialized_init.

	* test/unit/uninitialized_test.cpp: Add test to check correct
	detection of useless initialization.

2006-05-19  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* test/unit/uninitialized_test.cpp: Patch from Ulrich Eckhardt
	to replace vector instance in uninitialized_copy_test by static
	array so that we are always working on pointers iterator.

	* stlport/stl/_string_operators.h: Patch from Ulrich Eckhardt to
	add missing != operators when using string template expression.

	* stlport/stl/ctype.h, config/_evc.h, _msvc.h, _windows.h,
	features.h: Patch from Michael Fink for evc3/4 platform.

	* test/unit/mvctor_test.cpp: Add of a specific Borland test case
	to report what seems to be a compiler bug but that is only
	revealed when using STLport.

	* stlport/stl/_tree.h, _set.h, _map.h, debug/_tree.h,
	pointer/_set.h: Generalized already existing extension of template
	find method on associative containers to all look up methods:
	count, erase, lower_bound, upper_bound, equal_range.

	* test/unit/set_test.cpp: Add test case for set template methods
	extension.

	* stlport/stl/_tree.c, debug/_tree.h: Removed debug check from
	non debug implementation, now debug check is injected in tree
	implementation from the tree debug implementation thanks to
	a wrapping of the predicate.

2006-05-18  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/c_locale.h: Fix declaration of _Locale_name_hint
	struct so that compilers do not think that this struct is in
	the STLport namespace because of friend declaration.

2006-05-17  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_abbrevs.h: Update list of abbreviations.

	* stlport/stl/_hashtable.c: Removed _Node macro and fixed
	macros defined when _STLP_NESTED_TYPE_PARAM_BUG is defined.

2006-05-16  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* test/unit/type_traits_test.cpp: Add test case to check
	_TrivialUCopy helper metaprogramming class behavior.

	* stlport/stl/_vector.h, _vector.c: Replaced _TrivialAss by
	_TrivialCopy and _TrivialUCpy by _TrivialUCopy for coherency
	with type_traits.h names.

	* test/unit/type_traits_test.cpp: Add small test for correct
	impact of trivial_destructor meta info in vector implementation.

	* build/lib/configure.bat: Add comment to explain weird TARGETCPU
	check.

2006-05-15  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_hashtable.h, _list.h, _deque.h, _slist.h,
	_string.h, _vector.h, _move_construct_fwk.h, _rope.h:
	Fix impact of _STLP_NO_MOVE_SEMANTIC macro on library. Now,
	if defined, no move will ever happen.

	* stlport/stl/_uninitialized.h: Simplified __uninitialized_copy_fill
	prototype, only one type of iterator is allowed. It also fix
	implementation as this one was not taking into account both
	iterator value_type to consider if the operation was trivial
	or not.

	* stlport/stl/_uninitialized.h: Major code review. Remove use of
	_OKToMemcpy, remove dependency on std::copy of std::fill, all
	implementation is now similar to the one of std::copy algorithms
	except that uninitialized algo are using
	__type_traits::has_trivial_copy_constructor meta information and
	copy __type_traits::has_trivial_assign_operator.

	* test/unit/deque_test.cpp, vector_test.cpp: New test case for
	over optimization problem.

	* test/unit/map_test.cpp, locale_test.cpp, list_test.cpp, slist_test.cpp,
	unordered_test.cpp, fstream_test.cpp, stack_allocator.h: Fixed
	implementation to build with _STLP_NO_MEMBER_TEMPLATES.

	* stlport/stl/debug/_vector.h, _list.h: Add non template assign
	methods used when _STLP_NO_MEMBER_TEMPLATES is defined.

	* stlport/stl/_slist.c: Fixed sort _Slist_sort implementation, now
	call _Slist_merge template function rather than slist::merge method
	as this method do not take any predicate when _STLP_NO_MEMBER_TEMPLATES
	is defined.

	* build/test/unit/Makefile.inc, test/unit/uninitialized_test.cpp:
	New test for uninitialized_copy algo.

	* stlport/stl/type_traits.h: OKToMemCpy rename in _TrivialCopy for
	coherency with _TrivialUCopy. Moreover, thanks to refactoring in
	uninitialized_* algorithms, _TrivialUCopy now only takes into account
	__type_traits::has_trivial_copy_constructor meta information and
	not has_trivial_assign_operator.

	* stlport/stl/boost_type_traits.h: Fixed to reflect STLport
	__type_traits modifications.

	* stlport/stl/_uninitialized.h: Major code review proposed by
	Ulrich Eckhardt

	* stlport/stl/_algobase.h, _deque.h, _deque.c, _vector.h, _vector.c,
	_rope.h, _rope.c, _string.h, _string.c: Impact of previous point.

2006-05-05  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* test/unit/iter_test.cpp: Removed unreachable code.

	* Introduction of a new configuration macro _STLP_MSVC_LIB

	This macro is set to _MSC_VER value but can be overloaded to
	an other value. First intension was to make STLport more flexible
	for Intel C++ compiler. This compiler comes without any native
	lib and you have to bind it to a MSVC install, Intel compiler
	generate MSVC compatible code so that MSVC linker can correctly
	generate final exe or dll. To mimic MSVC compiler ICL also defines
	_MSC_VER. The problem is that definition of this macro is based
	on a compiler option and do not necessarily reflect the MSVC lib
	version ICL is binded to. Fortunately the compiler options
	responsible of _MSC_VER definition (/Qvc6, /Qvc7...) is also
	responsible of name mangling so asking for a MSVC compiler
	compatibility different than the library ICL is binded to is
	not easy. But _STLP_MSVC_LIB has been kept as it makes STLport
	configuration more clean. Now MSVC compiler version is given
	by _STLP_MSVC macro and library version by _STLP_MSVC_LIB.
	All occurences of _MSC_VER in STLport code has been replaced
	by those macros.

	* _STLP_USE_SECURIZED_BUF_FUNCTIONS replaced by the more
	intuitive _STLP_USE_SAFE_STRING_FUNCTIONS.

	* stlport/stl/config/_msvc.h: Major refactoring to isolate
	MSVC compiler config and MSVC native library config.
	
2006-05-04  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	removed some ICL specific configuration.

	* src/lock_free_slist.h: Removed 'no return statement' warning
	for ICL too.

	* src/message_facets.h: Made _Message_impl copy constructor and
	assignment operator private to avoid warning as _M_cat member
	data has private copy constructor and assignment operator too.

	* stlport/stl/_cstdlib.h: Made additional definition of
	div(long, long) based on native library (_MSC_VER) rather than on
	compiler used (_STLP_MSVC).

	in C style.

	* stlport/stl/_cmath.h: Add macro definition for environment
	having long double but no float neither long double math functions

	locale_catalog.cpp, locale_impl.cpp, locale_impl.h,
	message_facets.h, facets_byname.cpp: Add a locale hint feature

	* build/Makefiles/nmake/lib/clean.mak, rules-so.mak, rules-install-so.mak:
	Based on Dr Dobb's Richard Grimes article, change management of
	manifest file for STLport shared library. According this article
	.manifest file is not taken into account for a library, only .exe one is.
	Solution is to integrate .manifest file into the .dll as an unmanaged
	ressource with id 2. We now do so thanks to the mt manifest tool.

	* stlport/stl/_pair.h: Remove __move_traits partial specialization for
	Borland free compiler, it was introducing weird compilation error.

	* stlport/stl/_move_construct_fwk.h: Add a helper struct for __move_traits
	feature.

	and _Find_next.

	* test/unit/bitset_test.cpp: Adapt tests to previous modification.

	* stlport/stl/_string.h: Replace memory include with stl/_alloc.h

	own namespace rather than std so that STLport can check config.

	* stlport/typeinfo.h: Fix DMC configuration now that it uses own
	STLport namespace.

2006-04-05  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_tree.h, _list.h: Fixed swap implementation to
	correctly swap allocators instance. Moreover list swap implementation
	was wrong since list splice has been modified to correctly handled
	allocators with state.

	* test/unit/slist_test.cpp, list_test.cpp, set_test.cpp: Add tests for
	above fix.

	* stlport/stl/_deque.h: Fix swap method as deque has 2 allocator
	instances, this should perhaps be modified one day to only keep 1...

	equivalent allocator instances even if there are still other assertions
	in the implementation.

	thanks Eric Sanford.

	* test/unit/type_traits_test.cpp: Borland workaround for is_convertible

	relative to native headers access that used to be in features.h.

	* stlport/stl/config/_evc.h, _como.h: Add include of _native_headers.h
	as those compilers need to include native headers for correct
	configuration.

	* stlport/stl/config/features.h: Use _native_headers.h.

	* test/unit/locale_test.cpp: Made LocaleTest::facet_id test STLport
	specific rather than Borland specific. Moreover, without STLport, test
	is ignored rather than hidden.

	* src/locale_impl.cpp: Removed id initialization of useless facets
	no more exported.

	* stlport/new, stl/_new.h: Moved all STLport code in _new.h and
	modified new header so that it forwards include to native new
	when include comes from inside STLport.

	* cppunit/file_reporter.h, cppunit_mini.h: Change support of
	CPPUNIT_CHECK macro, only report error once for all failures
	in a single test case.

2006-03-28  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_prolog.h: Fix macro check before inclusion of
	features.h.

	* stlport/stl/char_traits.h: Fixed include of cstddef, in STLport
	code, Standard headers should never be included directly, their
	stlport/stl/_xxx.h counterpart should be used.

	__Named_exception implementation, improve segregation between
	<locale> and <stdexcept> Standard headers.

	* test/unit/locale_test.cpp: Add missing <stdexcept> header include.

	* stlport/stl/_function_base.h, _function.h: Move as many functor as
	possible from _function_base.h to _function.h to improve
	segregation between <functional> and <algorithm> Standard headers.

	* test/unit: Add many missing references to <functional> header.

	* test/unit: Made unit tests available for build without STLport, this
	will be a good way to compare Standard library implementations.

	* stlport/stl/_string_base.h: Remove additional space for terminating
	null character, it was actually already reserved in the return
	expression.

	* stlport/stl/_string.h: Restored basic_string capacity implementation
	that do not depend on use of the short string optimization or not. It
	might be hiding a real issue somewhere else in code even if unit tests
	are not showing any problem.

	* stlport/stl/_alloc.h: Add swap overload for _STLP_alloc_proxy class
	in order to correctly call swap on the maybe rebound allocator as user
	that implement an allocator with a state might have implement a
	special swap function for it to correctly handle STL containers swap
	operation.

2006-03-24  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* build/lib/configure.bat: Removed script for defining INCLUDE
	environment variable for Borland ressource compiler as it depends
	on where STLport is install.

	* build/lib/bcc.mak: Add check for INCLUDE environment variable
	definition.

	* test/unit/string_test.cpp: Change basic_string::reserve test to
	check length_error exception rather than bad_alloc.

	* src/allocators.cpp: Fixed thread safety issue in
	per_thread_allocator implementation thanks a very old William
	Power report.

	* test/unit/allocator_test.cpp: Attempt to write a test case for
	previous bug but not yet complete as I need a better debugging
	environment than gdb under cygwin...

	* stlport/stl/config/_system.h: Patch from Michael Fink to add
	missing _STLP_MSVC define for evc++ compilers.

2006-03-13  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	native process.h header, for reason see comment next to include
	in file.

	one. _STLP_alloc_proxy expose this new overload only for the
	STLport allocator and not for user defined allocators.

	* stlport/stl/_vector.h, _vector.c, _string.h, _string.c: Use of the
	allocate overload extension method to set end of storage reference
	to the real memory block end rather than to the requested one.

	* stlport/stl/_alloc.c: Adapt __debug_alloc::allocate method in order
	to return the real allocated memory block. Also add check on computed
	__real_n to allocate as it might roll on size_t and hide a case that
	should result in a bad_alloc exception.

	* stlport/stl/_threads.h, src/allocators.cpp: Add WINVER macro
	check in addition to _WIN32_VERSION, according PSDK documentation
	WINVER is more generaly used accross different Windows platforms.

	* test/unit/string_test.cpp: Add constructor test case to correctly
	handle build of a string with string::max_size elements which should
	result in a bad_alloc exception. Idem for reserve method.

	result in __malloc_alloc implementation to throw an exception when
	result is NULL.

	* src/locale_impl.cpp: Patch from Eric Sanford for Borland BDS 2006
	support. Mostly fix locale facet index issues.

	for report.

	* test/unit/string_test.cpp: test for capacity issue.

	* src/cxa.c: don't use cxa workaround for FreeBSD 6.0---it fine;
	this is rollback of changes 2006-01-24 [bad compiler was in use].

2006-02-15  Petr Ovtchenkov  <complement@users.sourceforge.net>

	[potential vulnerabilities]; directly use __iostring instead.

	* test/unit/floatio_test.cpp: test for fixed float output;
	cases when fixed float fail on Linux and Solaris, related
	with fcvt_r and fconvert calls respectivly commented.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/gcc.mak: workaround for bug in make 3.79.1
	on Solaris [not pass -D_STLP_DEBUG to CPPFLAGS].

	* stlport/stl/_string.h: rollback 2006-01-25.

2006-02-08  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* build/Makefiles: Removed all references to BUILD=r in parameters
	to ressource compiler in release as there is no more 'r' appended
	to the library name in this mode.

	definition before injecting it in original library file name.

	* doc/README.borland: Update doc to signal new prerequisite for

	it do not have to be a template class anymore.

	* stlport/stl/debug/_debug.c: Implement
	__stl_debug_engine<_Dummy>::_Message even when specifying
	_STLP_DEBUG_MESSAGE in order to have explicit instanciation correctly
	generated.

	* stlport/stl/_heap.c, _tree.c, _list.c, _slist.c: Add strict
	weak ordering checks.

	* stlport/stl/_debug.h, _debug.c: Add new error type: bad equivalent
	functor that has to be used in hash container implementation or in
	algorithm like find. Check for this functor is:
	if (pred(a, b)) assert(pred(b, a)

	* stlport/stl/_hashtable.c: Add equivalent functor checks.

	* stlport/stl/_debug.h, _debug.c: Check _STLP_DEBUG_MODE_THROW in

	brcc32 not brc32.

	* stlport/stl/_range_errors.h, src/dll_main.cpp: Add

	order to use potential internal workaround.

	* stlport/stl/config/_ibm.h: Replace all C++ comment by C comments.

	* stlport/errno.h: For Borland, when building for a single threaded
	contex, errno is not a macro and is defined in std namespace so using

	list implementation.

	* test/unit/mvctor_test.cpp, type_traits_test.cpp: Small workaround
	for gcc 4.0.1 build, looks like there is a conflict between glibc++
	__true_type and STLport one.

	interface.

	* stlport/stl/config/feature.h: Default allocator in _STLP_NO_IOSTREAMS
	mode is now the new/delete allocator, user can still use malloc/free
	one using config swtich in host.h.

	* stlport/stl/config/_gcc.h: Cygwin/MinGW can now use default node
	allocator implementation without memory leak.

2006-01-25  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	in streams operator when 64 bits portability issue detection
	feature is activated with MSVC compilers.

2006-01-25  Eric Sanford  <...@comp...>

	binding that show workaround for const function call.

	* src/cxa.c: __cxa_finalize and __cxa_atexit present in libc
	in FreeBSD 5.3, but again absent in 6.0

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/app/gcc.mak,
	build/Makefiles/gmake/lib/gcc.mak: detect whether gcc
	was builded with --disable-shared and use correct libgcc.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/app/clean.mak: Fix distclean rule for
	windows thanks Eric Sanford.

	* stlport/stl/_cstddef.h, _cstdlib.h: When no new header support,
	include STLport C header rather than native one to use errno
	workaround.

2006-01-22  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* src/locale_impl.cpp, stlport/stl/_codecvt.h, _monetary.c,
	_num_get.c, _num_put.c, _time_facets.c: Borland workaround for
	locale facet id instanciation that were duplicated. Now static
	instances are no more defined from .c files but only from the
	.cpp and only for facets that are implemented by STLport. Users
	implementing facet inheriting from the STLport one will have to
	defined the static instance themself in their translation units.
	
	* stlport/stl/type_manips.h: Fixed _UnCVType wrong implementation
	reported by Digital Mars compiler.

	* stlport/stl/boost_type_traits.h: Fixed _OKMemCpy implementation
	remove_pointer call was wrong.

	was useless and producing a warning.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/cygming/rules-so.mak: Workaround for DMC
	linker weird behavior. Linker create the dll file even if link
	fail which confuse make dependency feature. As lib file is not

	list warning, used in rope implementation.

	* build/lib/configure: Fix --with-boost interpretation.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/dmc.mak: Use dm_link command for linker rather
	than link that is rather the MSVC like wrapper.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/cygming/targetsys.mak: Ditto for dm_lib rather
	than lib command.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/app/rules.mak: Use same linker command invocation
	for DMC and Borland.

	* doc/README.borland: Documentation update about limitation on locale
	facets id instanciation.

	* stlport/stdlib.h: DMC, like Borland and EVC, defines errno macro
	in stdlib.h

	* stlport/stl/config/user_config.h, features.h: Inverse
	_STLP_FORCE_STRING_TERMINATION macro switch in
	_STLP_DONT_FORCE_STRING_TERMINATION. This is less dangerous for
	existing code.

	* stlport/stl/_string.h: When _STLP_FORCE_STRING_TERMINATION
	is defined operator[] implementation is simpler.

	* stlport/stl/debug/_string.h: Based implementation of []
	operator on the non STL safe internal instance, avoid duplication
	of check for access to the element of index size().

	* test/unit/fstream_test.cpp: Add custom facet id definition for
	Borland.

	* test/unit/hash_test.cpp: Now Borland support correctly hash container
	implementation.

	warning.

	* test/unit/string_test.cpp: Fixed unused variable warning.

2006-01-17  Petr Ovtchenkov  <complement@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/c_locale_glibc/c_locale_glibc2.c: really implemented
	getting default locale categories from environment; replace
	a few strcpy by strncpy to protect from possible buffer overflow
	attack.
	
	* stlport/new.h, stlport/stl/_typeinfo.h: few workarounds for ICC 9
	[suggested by Lim Hwan Cheol].

2006-01-14  Eric Sanford  <...@comp...>

	boost type traits.

	* src/dll_main.cpp: Remove now invalid template explicit
	instanciation of _Bs_G that is no more a template.

	* stlport/stl/config/_detect_dll_or_lib.h: When no iostreams mode,
	consider that we are in a static lib mode.

	* stlport/stl/_limits.c, _hashtable.c: Add _STLP_CALL specification
	to _LimG and _Stl_prime methods implementation.

	* stlport/stl/_limits.c: Put _Stl_prime methods implementation in
	a _STLP_EXPOSE_GLOBALS_IMPLEMENTATION macro check block. Those
	methods are supposed to come from libs when using iostreams.

	* stlport/stl/_num_put.h, _num_get.h, _time_facets.h, _ios.h,
	_ios_base.h: Cleanup Borland workaround now useless.

	* stlport/stl/_bitset.h: Add an inline implementation for _S_count
	and _S_first_one static methods for _STLP_NO_IOSTREAMS mode. Should
	be slower than version coming with library but avoid link trouble.

2006-01-11  Petr Ovtchenkov  <complement@users.sourceforge.net>

	* stlport/stl/_bitset.h, stlport/stl/_bitset.c, src/bitset.cpp:
	make helper structure _Bs_G non-template [it used only as instance
	with unused bool argument only], and put static tables into library
	to avoid possible static instances duplication.

	* build/lib/Makefile.inc: idem.

2006-01-10  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/type_traits.h, config/_msvc.h, _mwerks.h: Integrate
	intrinsic type traits support for Visual 2005 and Metrowerk. Code
	based on boost library information and not tested for Metrowerk.

	* test/unit/bind_test.cpp: Fix BindTest::bind2nd3 test case, had
	never been used.

	* stlport/stl/boost_type_traits.h: Change boost type traits wrapping
	implementation to use meta programming operation on types rather
	than on numerical constant, MSVC6 prefer it.

	* build/test/unit/msvc.mak: Systematically add /Zm800 for MSVC
	compilers, useful in a number of case and transparent in others.

	* test/unit/type_traits_test.cpp: Add is_POD test case. Add dummy
	constructors, assignment operator and destructor to any_type struct
	to make the tests pass even with compilers having intrinsic type
	traits support.
 
2006-01-09  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/debug: Fix move constructor to keep the container
	move constructor complete. When STLport user do no require no
	extension or Standard debug safe mode, iterators are also move
	with the container contents.

	* stlport/stl/_list.h, _slist.h, _tree.h: Made iterator struct
	constructor from base class pointer explicit to forbid expression
	like: list.begin() == 0.

	* stlport/stl/pointers/_slist.h, _list.h, _set.h: Fix implementation
	that was using former implicit contructor from pointer to base class.

	* src/c_locale_win32/c_locale_win32.c: Fix implementation for
	compilers coming with a native lib implementing secure C functions
	like strncpy_s.

	* src/iostream.cpp: Hide I/O streams declaration when defining
	them when compiler has no support for removing I/O streams
	from static global variable initialization segment. Avoid the
	stdio_istreambuf using directive when we do not use STLport
	private namespace.

	* stlport/stl/_rope.h, _rope.c: Use internal, not _STLP_NO_EXTENSIONS
	dependant functions for implementation.

	* stlport/rope, hash_map, hash_set: Add _STLP_NO_EXTENSIONS check
	that generate a #error if defined as those headers are STLport
	extensions.

	* stlport/_uninitialized.h: Add __uninitialized_copy_n no dependant
	against _STLP_NO_EXTENSIONS for rope implementation.

	* test/unit: Made tests ok to build even when _STLP_NO_EXTENSIONS or
	_STLP_NO_ANACHONISM or _STLP_NO_CUSTOM_IO is defined.

	implementation when _STLP_NO_IOSTREAMS is defined or when
	securized C function strcpy_s exists.

	* stlport/stl/pointers/_set.h: Fixed implementation as _Identity
	is now in private namespace and const_reverse_* functions must
	return const_reverse_* iterators and not simply reverse_*.

	* test/unit/bcompos_test.cpp, bind_test.cpp: Made the tests usable
	when _STLP_NO_EXTENSIONS is defined.

	* build/lib/configure.bat: Fix name of msvc8 compiler.

	* test/unit/mfunptr_test.cpp: Ignore find test when no class

	* src/*: Build with Intel C++ 9 compiler reveal that many
	static specification was missing.

	* src/ctype.cpp: Filter out _WCharIndexT specialization for
	Intel compiler that consider wchar_t as unsigned, fixed a
	warning.

	* stlport/stl/_string_io.c: Generalized use of _STLP_STATIC_ASSERT
	macro rather that hand writen static assertion.

	* src/stdio_streambuf.cpp: Ditto.

	* stlport/stl/_alloc.h: Now allocator is tagged as an STLport class
	even without partial template specialization support. This is
	necessary because type_traits is specialized for allocator<char>,
	allocator<wchar_t> and allocator<void*> when partial template
	specialization is not available.

	* test/unit/bitset_test.cpp: Add tests for the STLport
	bitset::_Find_first extension.

	declaration is. Also moved _Rope_Concat_fn at the same time, much more
	many elements of _rope.h should be moved to this namespace...

	* stlport/stl/_monetary.c: Change implementation of __money_do_put for
	Borland compiler, looks like this compiler do not like ternary operator.

	* src/c_locale_win32/c_locale_win32.c: Replace check of category in
	__Extract_locale_name from > LC_ALL by != LC_ALL, there is no reason
	for LC_ALL to be upper or lower to all other categories.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/cygming/rules-so.mak: Segregate different
	compilers linker calls and add reference to START_OBJ in Borland
	linker invocation.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/lib/rules-a.mak, cygming/targetsys.mak: Borland
	archiver add option is now '+', before being invocated archive is always
	deleted to avoid warnings because the Borland archiver do not have a
	real add or replace module option.

	* stlport/stl/type_traits.h: Fix for compiler simulating partial
	template specialization (VC6)

	* test/eh/test_rope.cpp: Removed rope test for Borland.

	* test/unit/exception_test.cpp: Commented tests are now ignored.

	* test/unit/locale_test.cpp, string_test.cpp: No more ignored test
	for Borland.

2005-12-14  Petr Ovtchenkov  <complement@users.sourceforge.net>

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/sysid.mak: parse two-token target
	system identification string along with three-token one
	[useful when vendor is omitted]; thanks Jonathan Sprinkle.

	* stlport/cwctype, stlport/stl/_cwctype.h: wctype_t and
	others are in global namespace on FreeBSD.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/app/gcc.mak, lib/gcc.mak: use build
	with -nostdlib on Solaris.

	* src/cxa.c: fix for Solaris

	* stlport/config/stl_solaris.h, stlport/stl/_cmath.h:
	hmm, strange... sometimes MATH_L and MATH_F present on Solaris,
	sometimes not...

2005-12-14  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* test/unit/cppunit/cppunit_mini.h, file_reporter.h: Add ignore
	test feature, now tests should be ignored rather than commented.
	2 new macros for that CPPUNIT_IGNORE to add in tests declaration,
	all test following this macro won't be run; CPPUNIT_STOP_IGNORE
	optional macro to stop ignoring tests.

	* test/unit/fstream_test.cpp: Ignore custom_facet test when not
	supported rather than comment it.

	* test/unit/hash_test.cpp: Ignore hmap1 test for Borland and Digital
	Mars compilers, looks like rope class is too complicated for those
	compilers.

	* test/unit/locale_test.cpp: Ignore locale_by_name test for compiler
	without exceptions support. Ignore money facet tests for Borland.

	* test/unit/mvctor_test.cpp, rope_test.cpp: Some tests ignored
	depending on various configuration settings.

	* test/unit/type_traits.cpp: Add test for _IsSTLportClass metaprogramming
	tool. Ignored for Borland.

	* test/unit/unordered_test.cpp: Fix test for Digital Mars, unordered
	containers value_type are not necessarily with an immutable key, it is
	more portable to use value type rather than redefining it in the test.

	* test/unit/string_test.cpp: Removed Windows CE macro check replaced
	by WaitForMultipleObjects returned code check, more portable and
	maintenable. Ignore a test for Digital Mars compiler.

	* stlport/stl/type_manips.h, type_traits.h: Simplified metaprograming
	tools implementation; now avoid compilation constant replaced by
	type, Borland compiler has problem with constants.

	* stlport/config/stl_bc.h: Made supported compiler check more accurate
	free compiler is 5.5.1 so it is the oldest supported version. Borland
	compiler do not support IEC559 specifications.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/bcc.mak: Put startup .obj to link with in
	START_OBJ rather than LDLIBS, thanks Eric Sanford.

	* src/c_locale_win32/c_locale_win32.c: Temporarily removed category
	check in __Extract_locale_name function for Borland, looks like LC_ALL
	or LC_MAX has not the right value.

2005-12-13  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* src/cxa.c: Add include of stlport_prefix.h first, this file
	should be always included first in STLport translation units,
	it prepares some compilers config and define important for Wins
	__BUILDING_STLPORT macro.

2005-12-13  Petr Ovtchenkov  <complement@users.sourceforge.net>

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/targetdirs.mak: built-in
	test in /bin/sh on Solaris has no -e, use external instead.

2005-12-11  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/bcc.mak : Add -w-eff to disable 'useless'
	code warning, we had to chose between this warning and the 'used
	parameter' one.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/targetdirs.mak: Removed comment about folder
	creation action under windows platform. The action is identical to
	the one used in the nmake build system and no one complains about it
	so current situation is not so bad. Only users of Windows before Windows
	98 should eperiment troubles, this is a known limitation.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/dmc.mak, cygming/rules-so.mak: Change config,
	now we directly invoke the linker, we do not use a compiler call for it.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/app/bcc.mak: Fix linker option in order to generate
	a windows executable and not a dll, thanks Eric Sanford.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/app/rules-install.mak: Add install dir dependency
	rather than doing a folder existence check in rules actions.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/app/rules.mak: Restore slash rotation for Borland
	linker invocation and fix static rules dependencies to guaranty folder
	creations.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/lib/bcc.mak: Add missing archiver page size parameters.

	* build/test/unit/bcc.mak: Add _STLP_DEBUG_UNINITIALIZED for static
	debug rules.

	for windows and missing catalog in dependency tree.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/windows/rules-install-so.mak: Add missing
	catalog dependency.

2005-12-09  Petr Ovtchenkov  <complement@users.sourceforge.net>

	* build/lib/Makefile.inc: add cxa.c into compilation; this
	is useful for FreeBSD 4.11 C++ ABI workaround.

	* src/cxa.c: use _cxa_atexit and related functions on
	FreeBSD 4.11 [workaround for missed C++ ABI functions].

2005-12-08  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_auto_ptr.h: Add missing Standard throw() specification
	on all auto_ptr members.

	* stlport/config/stl_mycomp.h: Removed recently introduce macro
	_STLP_DFLT_PARAM_INSTANCIATION_BUG, already existing _STLP_DONT_SUP_DFLT_PARAM
	is enough for the moment.

	* stlport/stl/_stream_iterator.h: Small implementation change to make
	Digital Mars compiler happy.

	* stlport/stl/_unordered_map.h: Digital Mars compiler do not like
	immutable keys in associative containers.

2005-12-08  Petr Ovtchenkov  <complement@users.sourceforge.net>

	* stlport/ctype.h: forward-declaration for _exception struct
	for WinCE/eVC3; prevents warning message
	../include/stdlib.h(817) : warning C4115:
	'_exception' : named type definition in parentheses
	[Michael Fink's suggestion]

	* stlport/float.h, stlport/limits.h, stlport/setjmp.h: idem.

	* stlport/stdarg.h, stlport/string.h, stlport/stdio.h: idem.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/gcc.mak: check configuration macro
	WITHOUT_STLPORT [useful for tests]; force usage of stlport
	headers first otherwise.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/targetdirs.mak: fix catalogs creation
	procedure [loop through catalogs required]; comment problematic
	code when we have no good tools.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/lib/gcc.mak: fix typo [FreeBSD]; fix
	set of libraries when link for FreeBSD; fix typo in macro name
	[FreeBSD again].

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/app/gcc.mak: fix set of libraries when
	link for FreeBSD; insert stlport lib in STDLIB set [when STLPORT
	in force], to avoid set one in application's makefile.

	* build/test/unit/gcc.mak: explicit refrence to libstlport in
	this makefile not required more [see message above].

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/lib/gcc.mak: remove names inherited from
	Complement project.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/*/rules-install-so.mak: installation
	catalog was missed in dependency tree; ident string removed
	to simplify merge/diff

	* Build: building library and unit tests with cross [gcc 3.4.5]
	on Linux for FreeBSD 5.3 (except cwctype_test).

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/targets.mak: rotate slashes for BCC.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/app/macro.mak: remove name contruction
	for program; rotate slashes for wins.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/app/rules-install.mak: remove name
	contruction for program.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/app/rules.mak: remove name contruction
	for program; objects for static and for dynamic are the same. 
	
2005-12-04  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* src/num_put_float.cpp: Filter inclusion of stdint.h, required for
	Digital Mars compiler, forbidden for Sun platform.

	* stlport/stl/_cwctype.h: wide types and function are in global
	namespace.

	* build/test/unit/gcc.mak: Modify cygwin/mingw config now that
	default settings for those platform is shared library.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake: Add support of static targets, used
	especially for Borland C++ Compiler and Digital Mars Compiler.

	STLport dll based on a static native runtime.

	* stlport/stl/_locale.h: Fix warning convertion from size_t to
	__stl_atomic_t that can be of lower size.

	* stlport/config/stl_gcc.h, doc/README.mingw, README.cygwin: Made dll
	default settings under cygwin/mingw.
	
2005-12-01  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_mbstate_t.h: Add workaround for alpha bad WCHAR_MIN and
	WCHAR_MAX definition.

	* stlport/config/stl_gcc.h: Configure STLport for alpha platform as not
	supporting iec559 specification as quiet nan is not correct. If someone
	find the right value then this config will have to be rollbacked.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/gcc.mak: Restored Sun OS support that use the
	-pthreads option and not -pthread

	* build/Makefiles/nmake/lib/macro.mak: Fixed library name generation
	when using cross runtime version thanks Alexey Ivanov report.

2005-11-29  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl_user_config.h: Add _STLP_LIB_NAME_MOTIF macro to give
	users a point of customization of the automatic linking feature.

	* build/Makefiles/nmake/lib/macro.mak, gmake/cygming/lib.mak: Use
	STLP_BUILD_LIB_MOTIF in library name generation algorithm. Also take
	into account cross builds in library name generation.

	* build/lib/configure.bat: Add --lib-motif option to give users a
	way to customize the generated library names.

	* test/eh: Generalized use of msvc.mak rather than all the nmake-vc??.mak
	files. Idem for evc.mak instead of nmake-evc?.mak and icl.mak instead of
	nmake-icl.mak.

	* stlport/stl/_exception.h: Change _msvc_warnings_off.h include in
	_warnings_off.h as this file now also turn off Borland warnings.

	* stlport/config/_detect_dll_or_lib.h: Mutualization of code used to
	detect current STLport type of build or usage (dll or static lib).

	* stlport/config/stl_msvc.h, stl_bc.h, stl_dmc.h: Integration of
	_detect_dll_or_lib.h

	* stlport/config/_auto_link.h: Change auto link algo when we detect
	cross STLport usage that is to say use of STLport as a dll link with
	static native runtime or opposite.

2005-11-29  Petr Ovtchenkov  <complement@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/cxa.c: mutex should be recursive-safe, due to __cxa_finalize
	may be called recursive.

2005-11-28  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_threads.h: Simplified expression used to instanciate
	_Atomic_swap_struct, gcc 2.95 had trouble with the one line expression.

	* src/dll_main.cpp: Fix instanciation of _Swap_lock_struct that has been
	changed and renamed in _Atomic_swap_struct.

	* test/unit/map_test.cpp, set_test.cpp: Simplified call to map constructor
	taking a functor and allocator instance, split it in a creation of a les<int>
	instance then passed to the constructor; gcc 2.95 had trouble with previous
	version.

	* stlport/stl/_cmath.h, _cstdlib.h: Now those files includes each other to
	make sure that all abs overloads are defined when it is imported in STLport
	namespace. gcc 2.95 is very strict on this point and only consider the abs
	overloads existing at the first import calls, all overloads added after that
	are discarded silently.

	* stlport/stl/_cmath.h: Removed unjustified abs function overloads done
	directly in STLport namespace for gcc 2.95 and before. Those overloads
	clashed on a Linux with gcc 2.95 from the sourceforge compiler farm. 

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/gcc.mak: Generalized definition of _REENTRANT under
	Linux to make detection of a multithreaded build from STLport code easier.
	Problem meet on an alpha linux platform from the sourceforge compiler farm.

	* stlport/stl/_locale.h: Removed _M_delete locale::facet member variable,
	useless if facet instance reference counter is right.

	* src/locale_impl.cpp, message.cpp: Change classic facets initialization code
	to simply set initial counter to 1 rather than incrementing it after construction.

	* test/unit/evc.mak fix path to config file in existance check.

	* stlport/stl/_move_construct_fwk.h, type_manips.h: Add workaround to use
	move constructor with Borland compiler.

2005-11-28  Petr Ovtchenkov  <complement@users.sourceforge.net>

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/targetdirs.mak: change names of .o output dirs
	to make bcc happy (bug with passing name that contain '-' from
	compiler to linker). Replacement: 'shared' -> 'so', 'static' -> 'ar',
	'-' -> '_' (i.e. obj/gcc/shared-stlg -> obj/gcc/so_stlg, a bit shorter)
	[Suggested by Francois Dumont].

2005-11-27  Petr Ovtchenkov  <complement@users.sourceforge.net>

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/targets.mak, app/rules.mak, linux/rules-so.mak:
	use gcc instead of c++ as linker if there are no C++ objects.

	* src/cxa.c, build/misc/cxa_atexit/Makefile.inc, build/misc/cxa_atexit/gcc.mak:
	workaround for bugged __cxa_finalize; use builded libcxa.so in LD_PRELOAD or
	/etc/ld.so.preload in Linux system with bugged glibc. See also
	http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=24189

2005-11-27  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/type_manips.h: Add import of __true_type and
	__false_type in STLport private namespace as the using namespace
	directive do not seems to be enough for latest gcc version.

	* src/time_facets.cpp: Fix buffer size decrementation in __write_formatted_time
	function thanks Petr Ovtchenkov

2005-11-26  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_complex.h: Move implementation of generic abs, arg and polar
	after definition of double overload used in implementation. Thanks Kees de
	Bruin

	* stlport/stl/_threads.h, _alloc.h, _alloc.c: Fix lock free node allocator
	implementation thanks Weis.

	* stlport/stl/wrappers: Removed, no more maintained and complicated to fix
	with the debug and pointer specialization implementations.

	* test/unit/stack_allocator.h: Creation of an allocator using a stack buffer.
	This allocator specificity is to not be stateless and not default constructible.

	* test/unit/list_test.cpp, stlport/stl/_list.h, _list.c: Add of a test with the
	StackAllocator. Fix list implementation to correctly handle allocator state
	in the methods moving elements from a list instance to an other.

	* stlport/stl/_carray.h: Creation of a new internal struct _CArray that mimic a C
	array with the additionnal feature of being able to be instanciated with a type
	without default constructor.

	* stlport/stl/debug/_list.h: Adapt iterator invalidation according allocators
	compare result.

	* test/unit/slist_test.cpp, stlport/stl/_slist.h, _slist.c: idem list.

	* stlport/stl/_slist.h: Modification of the splice_after methods signature. Users
	now have to pass the source slist instance, this is mandatory in order to compare
	the 2 slists allocator instance before moving an element from a slist instance to
	an other.

	* stlport/stl/_string_base.h: Fix _M_swap implementation for basic_string instanciation
	with allocator having a state.

	* stlport/stl/_list.c, _slist.c: sort methods now throw an overflow exception when lists
	are too long to be sorted with the current algorithm. This is preferable to a buffer
	overrun.

	* stlport/stl/_alogobase.c: Small equal_range optimization, upper_bound is not called
	anymore when lower_bound returned value is already not equivalent to the search value.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake: Add build system for Digital Mars and Borland C++ compilers

	* build/lib/configure.bat: Add following options
	  --use-boost
	  --not-thread-safe
	  --no-rtti
	see script for explanation. --mingw removed, detected with --compiler option, if
	gcc, dmc or bcc then we are using MinGW tools.

	* build/lib/configure: Add --not-thread-safe option

	* build/Makefiles: Add build options to generate not thread safe libs and no rtti libs,
	all compilers option has not been updated.

	* stlport/c*: Modification of C++ headers wrapping C ones. All code moved to internal
	headers in stlport/stl folder. Internal headers are only included if include comes from
	user code otherwise only native header is included. Limit dependency between STLport
	headers relations and native library once. Reported by problem building with Borland
	compiler.

	* test/unit/cppunit/cppunit_mini.h: Replace cstring include with string.h to avoid
	references to std namespace in headers, should be more portable. Add typedef Base
	definition in CPPUNIT_TEST_SUITE macro, used in calls to base class methods, help
	Borland.

	* Generalize use of secure string functions (strcpy_s for instance) for MSVC compilers
	supporting it and tagging former versions like deprecated. The pragma warning that used
	to disable this warning has been removed.

	* stlport/BC50: Removed, no necassry anymore for supported Borland compiler versions.

	* stlport/stl/debug: Implementation modification, now debug wrapper agregate a non debug
	instance rather than inheriting from it. Makes debug implementation clearer as we are now 
	forced to implement the complete containers interfaces.

	* stlport/stl/pointers: Fix implementation in order to support Standard compilers
	not accepting cast from function pointer to void*.

	* *: Reinforce use of STLport private namespace (stlp_priv or stlport::priv) for all
	internals algorithms.

2005-11-21  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* Fix classic locale facet initial reference counter thanks
	Cabal

2005-11-20  Petr Ovtchenkov  <complement@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/num_put.h: check that incoming string has enough
	digits for fractional part processing. This check includes
	check for empty incoming string. (Thanks Leonardo [leoapsilva]
	for the bug report).

	* stlport/stl/_monetary.c: fix processing the case when
	number of digits in value less then number of digits in fraction.

	* src/facets_byname.cpp: international currency symbol should
	be the first (not depends upon where currency symbol situated in
	the national format).

	* test/unit/locale_test.cpp: tests for reproducing this problems.

2005-11-20  Gail Baker  <baker88@users.sourceforge.net>

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/CC.mak: Updated compiler option
	to compile larger inline functions inline.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/lib/CC.mak: Changed how the header
	file linking is done to only do it once instead of with
	every compile.

	* build/lib/README: include instructions for SunPro compiler.
 
	* build/test/unit/CC.mak: allow the STLP_DEBUG version to compile.

2005-11-19  Petr Ovtchenkov  <complement@users.sourceforge.net>

	* stlport/stdlib.h: replace C++ comments by C, to satisfy -ansi
	option of compiler.

2005-11-18  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* build/Makefiles/nmake/lib/rules-install-so.mak, 
	app/rules-install-so.mak: Add copy of manifest file when exist
	rather than when compiler is Visual Studio 2005.

	* src/stdio_streambuf.cpp: Removed warning for EVC 3 and 4 thanks
	Michael Fink patch.

	* stlport/stl/math.h, stdlib.h: Fix EVC3 warning thanks Michael Fink
	patch.

	* doc/README.evc3: doc update from Michael Fink.

	* stlport/*, stlport/*, tests/*: Clean up of trailing blank charaters
	in all source files.

2005-11-17  Gail Baker  <baker88@users.sourceforge.net>

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/CC.mak, depend.mak, app/CC.mak, lib/CC.mak:
	support of SunPro 5.7 compiler.

	* build/lib/CC.mak: ditto

	* stlport/stl/_rope.c: Removed extra semi-colons.
	
	* stlport/stl/_rope.h: Sunpro compiler had a problem with
	the __ROPE_DEPTH_SIZE macro doing an addition. Changed to
	a fixed value instead.

	* stlport/cstdlib: Updated to allow the compiler to find abs and div

	* stlport/config/stl_sunpro.h: Disabled _STLP_LINK_TIME_INSTANTIATION
	since this nolonger works with current files. The issue here is that
	a number of defines that are required in the C versions of the files
	use defines that are undefed at the end of the include. So, when
	the compiler finally compiles the C version at link time the defines
	are lost and the files don't compile. Also added a minor change
	to allow files that are compiled with cc to include stl_sunpro.h
	without bailing out.

	* stlport/stl/_bvector.h: Added stl/_range_errors.h required by
	an exception that can be called.

	* stlport/stl/_cmath.h: Changed to pull all math functions from std
	namespace for SunPro compiles only.

	* test/unit/fstream_test.cpp: Added SunPro compile to the list
	of compilers that don't use the DO_CUSTOM_FACET_TEST.

	* test/unit/string_test.cpp: Added Sun UI Threads to the list
	of supported thread types in the test.

	* test/unit/valarray_test.cpp: The compiler was having trouble
	finding abs(). Added a "using std::abs" for the SunPro compiler
	which solved the problem.

	* test/unit/cppunit/cppunit_mini.h: Added additional using statements
	for the str* commands.

	* test/unit/cppunit/test_main.cpp: Added "using namespace std;"
	for the SunPro compiler.

	* build/test/unit/CC.mak: support of SunPro 5.7 compiler

2005-11-17  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_messages_facets.h, src/messages.cpp: Move message facet
	constructor private to guaranty that it is only called from the _Locale_impl
	class for classic locale facets creation. Change constructor implementation
	as now passed _Message instance is dynamically instanciated so needs to be
	destroy on facet destruction; moreover the facet is also dynamically allocated
	and has to be destroyed when reference counter reach 0.

	* src/locale_impl.cpp: Removed call to now useless free_classic_locale function.
	Change make_classic_locale implementation, now classic locale facets are
	allocated on the heap and have to be destroyed like any ordinary facets
	when reference counter reach 0.

2005-11-15  Petr Ovtchenkov  <complement@users.sourceforge.net>

	* stlport/stl/_tree.h: check iterator returned from lower_bound
	in equal_range_unique for end, to avoid increment [useful when
	key not available].

	* test/unit/map_test.cpp: test for problem above.

2005-11-09  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* build/test/eh/gcc.mak: Fix build system for Cygwin/MinGW systems that
	was broken since library naming convention modification.

2005-11-07  Michael Fink  <vividos@users.sourceforge...>

	* build/lib/configure.bat: Fixed configuring for Visual Studio .NET 2003.
	Fixed jump target names for Win9x OSes: they must be 8 characters or
	shorter.

2005-11-07  Michael Fink  <vividos@users.sourceforge...>

	* build/Makefiles/nmake/evc3.mak, build/Makefiles/nmake/evc4.mak,
	build/lib/configure.bat, stlport/config/stl_evc.h: Added check if
	using x86 emulator configuration; using of proper include paths in
	case.

2005-10-09  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/config/stl_gcc.h: DEC alpha has not *l math functions

2005-10-08  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_config.h: Add endianess specification for DEC alpha thanks
	sourceforge compiler farm.

	* stlport/config/stl_intel.h: Remove reference to _STLP_GLOBAL_NEW_HANDLER
	in this file as this macro depends on native Standard library which is
	the back end MSVC compiler one so macro set in stl_msvc.h.

2005-10-07  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/darwin/sys.mak, freebsd/sys.mak: Fix EXT_TEST

	when building static libraries. Thanks Albrecht Fritzsche

	* stlport/stl/_ostream.h, _ostream.c: Move _M_init function implementation
	from .c to .h as .c is not included when _STLP_NO_CUSTOM_IO is defined
	but _M_init might not be exported if compiler fully inline it.

2005-10-03  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_tree.h: Fix _S_value method definition that returns
	a value_type& rather than the reference typedef as reference might be,

	* INSTALL, README, doc/FAQ, doc/README.msvc: Documentation updates.

	* doc/stlport_namespaces.txt: Small doc about STLport namespaces and how

2005-09-25  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* build/test/unit/gcc.mak: Remove _STLP_LEAKS_PEDANTIC option when building
	unit tests as this option is not defined when building the libs.

2005-09-22  Petr Ovtchenkov  <complement@users.sourceforge.net>

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/sysid.mak: add underscore in architecture recognition,
	to parse targets like x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.

2005-09-21  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* src/locale.cpp, facets_byname.cpp: Use of _STLP_ATOMIC_INCREMENT rather than
	a lock on a mutex when the macro is available.

2005-09-21  Petr Ovtchenkov  <complement@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/locale_impl.cpp: some internal functions used before declared.
	Thanks Thomas Kho for report.

2005-09-20  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_string.h, _string_workaround.h: code refactoring, substr method
	now use string constructor taking same parameters rather than the range
	constructor, thanks Felix Wyss report. Also add missing allocator parameter
	for non stateless allocators.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake: Restore resource build for Cygwin and MinGW, add
	it for Windows.

	* build/lib/configure.bat: Add --extra-cxxflag to inject additional compilation
	option in the nmake build system.

2005-09-20  Petr Ovtchenkov  <complement@users.sourceforge.net>

	* test/unit/ptrspec_test.cpp: gcc 2.95 fail to roll out template instantiation
	for pointers to member function, skip this test for gcc 2.95.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/gcc.mak: gcc 2.95 has no -fuse-cxa-atexit option.

	* build/lib/gcc.mak: don't use LEAK_PEDANTIC with gcc 2.95 [but this not help,
	segfault at program termination still happens].

	* stlport/config/stl_gcc.h: gcc 2.95 has problem with llabs, so force to use
	_STLP_NO_VENDOR_STDLIB_L; 2.95 fails to initialize builtin types.

	* stlport/stl/_cmath.h: workaround for gcc 2.95---it has problem with 'using'
	directive [problem with 'abs' with float types as argument].

	* stlport/stl/type_traits.h: workaround for gcc 2.95 [parentheses around
	template argument]. Thanks Thomas Kho.

	* test/unit/fstream_test.cpp: custom facet test compilation fail for gcc 2.95

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/icc.mak, build/test/unit/icc.mak: support icc 9.0,
	thanks John Fisher-Ogden and Thomas Kho.

	* src/c_locale_glibc/c_locale_glibc2.c: use newlocale/freelocale for
	glibc 2.3.x, and __newlocale/__freelocale for glibc 2.2.x. Thanks Gail Baker.

2005-09-19  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* build/Makefiles/nmake/clean.mak, lib/clean.mak, app/clean.mak: Add check
	for file or folder existance before calling del or rd to avoid error
	messages that give a bad feed back to STLport users.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake: Add support to use the GNU make tool in a Windows
	cmd console. For the moment it is used to build STLport using a simple
	MinGW distrib.

	* stlport/stl/type_traits.h: Simplified code removing the _IsConvertibleIfNot
	that has never proved of being useful, it only introduces problem with some
	limited compilers.

	* stlport/stl/_string_workaround.h, _string.h, debug/_string.h: Fix string
	range constructor bug in the VC6 specific workaround implementation that was
	resulting in a memory leak. Thanks Felix Wyss report.

2005-09-18  Petr Ovtchenkov  <complement@users.sourceforge.net>

	* stlport/stl/_hash_fun.h: add hash function for void *.

	* src/facets_byname.cpp, src/message_facets.h: introduce map between
	nl_catd type [that is void * on Linux] and messages_base::catalog
	[that is int by Standard]; this should remove problems on platforms
	where sizeof(int) < sizeof(void *).

2005-09-16  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/cwchar: Add MinGW 3.8 runtime wide-char to multi-byte functions
	import within STLport namespace thanks Rene Riviera.

2005-09-14  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/config/stl_gcc.h: Mingw support string wide functions thanks
        Rene Riviera report.

2005-09-13  Petr Ovtchenkov  <complement@users.sourceforge.net>

	* stlport/stl/_thread.h: fix return type specification
	[volatile void * -> void *].

2005-09-12  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_thread.h: Fix _Atomic_swap_ptr implementation in single
	threaded mode and when there is no pointer atomic swap operation.

	* stlport/stl/_site_config.h: Add _STLP_NO_CYGWIN macro to signal use
	of the -mno-cygwin cygwin option.

	* build/lib/configure: Remove automatic generation of stlport/script_config.h.

2005-09-11  Petr Ovtchenkov  <complement@users.sourceforge.net>

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/sysid.mak: provide identification hosted platform.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/targetdirs.mak: CygWin/MinGW has no /usr/bin/test,
	but built-in test support -e; see record 2005-09-04.

	* build/Makefiles/top.mak: separate hosted platform and target platform
	file extentions, tools, utilites.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/?/sys.mak, build/Makefiles/gmake/?/targetsys.mak:
	ditto.

2005-09-09  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* src/c_locale_win32.c: Fix _Locale_wchar_[tolower,toupper] implementation
	which was wrong when wint_t was not the same typedef as wchar_t.

	* build/lib/configure: Removed obsolete configure options --with-msvc and
	--with-mssdk. And --no-cygwin option to make build of STLport using -mno-cygwin
	option easier.

	* stlport/script_config.h: New header used to put additionnal macros defined
	by the configure script.

	* stlport/stl/_config.h: Add script_config.h include.

	* stlport/config/stl_gcc.h: Use of the new _STLP_NO_CYGWIN macro to set
	the right _STLP_NATIVE_INCLUDE_PATH macro value.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/gcc.mak: Change CC and CXX assignment from := to
	?= to take into account an already existing definition.

2005-09-07  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* build/Makefiles/gmake: Adopt a more traditionnal unixes naming
	convention for cygwin and mingw.

	* build/Makefiles/nmake: Attempt to make STLport library names more
	coherent between unixes and windows systems. Now windows use the 5.0
	extension like under unixes even if under unixes the file extension
	is before the 5.0 and under windows it will be after. The other
	difference is that the debug suffix is 'g' when using gcc and 'd' for
	the other compilers. This modification comes from a work to improve
	STLport integration within boost build system, bjam.

	* stlport/config/stl_msvc.h: Modify MSVC auto link feature to reflect
	above modifications.

2005-09-06  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/config/stl_gcc.h: Fix cygwin config that do have native
	mbstate_t definition.

2005-09-05  Petr Ovtchenkov  <complement@users.sourceforge.net>

	* repository: RC5, tag STLPORT_5_0_RC5

2005-09-04  Petr Ovtchenkov  <complement@users.sourceforge.net>

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/targetdirs.mak: in sh's built-in 'test' no -e
	option on Solaris, use external 'test' instead.

	* build/test/unit/gcc.mak: Fix LDSEARCH recursive problem; fix
	options for ld search path for some platforms.

	* stlport/cstdlib, stlport/stl/_cmath.h: fix usage of native
	?f and ?l math functions on Solaris; hypot for long double should't
	loose precision, if no native C function present.

2005-09-02  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/config/stl_msvc.h, stl/_move_construct_fwk.h: Add the 
	_STLP_NO_MOVE_SEMANTIC configuration macro to remove move semantic
	support for MSVC .Net 2002 that seems to be unable to support it.
	Maybe we should rather remove this compiler version support...

	* test/unit/mvctor_test.cpp: Add _STLP_NO_MOVE_SEMANTIC check.

2005-08-31  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* build/Makefiles/nmake: Enhance nmake build system to correctly take
	into account the .manifest files generated by VS 2005 Beta.

2005-08-29  Petr Ovtchenkov  <complement@users.sourceforge.net>

	* CVS repository: CVS repository master copied from cvs.stlport.com to SourceForge.
	All history preserved!

2005-08-27  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_hashtable.h: Fix move feature integration for the hash_multimap
	container.

	* stlport/stl/_deque.h: Fix _Deque_base move constructor implementation.

	* test/unit/mvctor_test.cpp: Change move constructor tests to use dynamically
	allocated string rather than static ones.

	* build/test/unit/nmake-vc6.mak: Increase compiler maximum heap size to allow
	compilation with stldbg rules.

	* build/test/unit/nmake-evc4.mak: Fix macro typo OPT_STLDBG_STATIC -> 
	OPT_STATIC_STLDBG

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/gcc.mak: Filter out the newly added -fuse-cxa-atexit
	compilation option for Cygwin and Mingw, the granted libc is not compatible
	with it.

2005-08-26  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr@island...>

	* stlport/config/stl_solaris.h: C++ comments replaced by C ones,
	this file may be included by C sources. Thanks Matti Rintala.

2005-08-25  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_config.h, _epilog.h: Move of stlport namespace alias
	definition from _epilog.h to _config.h to avoid redefinition as _epilog.h
	is reentrant. This is a workaround for a HPUX aCC compiler bug reported
	by Baker.

2005-08-25  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr@island...>

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/gcc.mak: usage of -fuse-cxa-atexit strongly
	required for correct order of static objects dtors calls. This is
	used in deinitialization of locale-related objects. Thanks Matti Rintala.

	* stlport/stl/_config.h: use different namespaces for mulithreaded
	and non-multithreaded builds to avoid usage of non-multithreaded
	application with multithreaded libstlport and vice versa;
	[combination non-mt & mt lead to crash due to different instances
	and sizes of allocators for non-mt and mt cases].

2005-08-23  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_config_compat.h: Add check of _STLP_NO_OWN_IOSTREAMS
	macro to make remove of its support more explicit thanks to a #error
	directive.

	* stlport/stl/_tree.h, _hashtable.h: Now reference and pointer types
	are taken from the _Traits template parameter used to instanciate
	the class. Doing so now set::reference and hash_set::reference are
	const_reference which is coherent with respective iterators that are
	immutable. Moreover it fixes a VC6 bug in reverse_iterator implementation
	that was trying to transform a const reference to a simple reference
	thanks Russell Miller report.

	* test/unit/set_test.cpp: New test case for set reverse_iterator.

2005-08-23  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr@island...>

	* stlport/config/stl_gcc.h: seems HP-UX has no *f variants of math
	functions [ceilf, fabsf, etc.]

2005-08-21  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_string.h, _rope.h: Removed __move_traits specialization
	for string wstring crope and wrope. There is no reason to believe that
	its move construtor will be complete as an STLport user has the right
	to specialized the std::allocator<> with char or wchar_t.

	* stlport/stl/_function_base.h, _alloc.h: Generalized use of the
	__stlport_class struct rather than introducing a new helper type
	(__stlport_less or __stlport_alloc) when we need to recognize STLport
	implementation from a user one.

2005-08-20  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_list.h, _slist.h: Fix move constructor implementation
	thanks Henrik Goldman (www.x-formation.com) report.

	* stlport/stl/_alloc.h: Fix type_traits specialization for allocator
	type. Now specialization is only apply for the default STLport allocator
	implementation and not for potential user specialization.

	* stlport/stl/_deque.h, _hashtable.h, _string.h, _tree.h, _vector.h:
	Simplification of the move framework application especially in the
	definition of the containers __move_traits specialization. Many
	_AsMoveSource call replaced by explicit call to the move constructor
	when we are sure that there is one.

	* test/unit/mvctor_test.cpp: Add many tests to check move contructor
	implementations.

	* stlport/stl/_function_base.h: Add type_traits specialization for the
	less functor to help the move framework when dealing with associative
	containers.

	* test/unit/mvctor_test.cpp: Add a new test case checking correct move
	semantic support for all STL containers.

	* stlport/stl/_rope.h: Add move semantic support to the rope class.

2005-08-19  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr@island...>

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/gcc.mak: fix extraction of gcc version.
	Thanks Thomas Kho.

2005-08-18  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_deque.c: Fix _M_erase range for movable types method
	implementation, same bug as below in vector.

	* test/unit/mvctor.cpp: Improve test case on vector to reveal bug
	below and add same tests for deque which is the other container that
	use the move contructor feature.

2005-08-18  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr@island...>

	* INSTALL: add some words about multithread options and libraries.

	* stlport/stl/_fstream.c: some code clean to reduce bogus compiler
	warnings with -Wall.

	* stlport/config/stl_gcc.h: seems HP-UX has no llabs and lldiv.

2005-08-17  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_vector.h: Fix _M_erase range for movable types
	implementation thanks Sergej Zagursky.

	* build/Makefiles/nmake/vc8.mak: removed /RTC1 compiler option, the platform
	SDK compiler do not support it. STLport users will just have to activate it
	by themself if they want to.

	* stlport/stl/_complex.h: Fix some floating point literals thanks
	 Ulrich Eckhardt report.

	* stlport/stl/_time_facets.c: Complete integration of the '#' MS extension
	in the date/time format string, reported thanks to the recent locale time_get
	new test case.

2005-08-14  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/config/stl_msvc.h: Fix platform SDK compiler config, even latest
	version that announce to be similar to .Net 2005 beta do not throw bad_alloc
	from the new operator.

	* stlport/cstdio, cstdlib: Replaced some _WIN64 checks by a
	_STLP_USING_PLATFORM_SDK_COMPILER check.

	* test/unit/cmath_test.cpp: Complete test filtering for Microsoft platform SDK
	compiler.

2005-08-14  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr@island...>

	* test/unit/locale_test.cpp: tests for time_get facet.

	* stlport/stl/_time_facets.c: fix processing of %p format
	[12:00 PM ~ 12:00, 12:00 AM ~ 00:00].

	* src/time_facets.cpp: substitute expanded equivalent format strings
	instead of %T, %R, %r.

	* stlport/pthread.h: Fix C++ comment in a potentially C header. Thanks Ali

2005-08-11  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl_user_config.h: Add _STLP_USING_PLATFORM_SDK_COMPILER so that
	STLport user can signal they are using platform SDK compiler.

	* stlport/config/stl_msvc.h: Add use of _STLP_USING_PLATFORM_SDK_COMPILER.

	* test/unit/cmath_test.cpp, valarray_test.cpp: Removed tanh calls when using
	AMD 64 platform SDK compiler, looks like they miss something...

2005-08-09  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* src/fstream.cpp: Final fix of basic_filebuf::open method. Now when open
	from a Win32 handle the file will be considered as in binary access with no
	append action.

2005-08-08  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* src/fstream.cpp: Fix annoying 64 warning and basic_filebuf::open method
	from a low level file descriptor or from an HANDLE (not yet complete).
	Thanks Yves Maliet report.

2005-08-07  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* test/unit/inner_product.cpp: Fix 64 bits portability warning.

	* test/unit/cmath_test.cpp: Removed modf tests for Windows 64 platform
	as the SDK is missing the underlying modff implementation.

	* stlport/cstdlib: Add a div function definition which is missing in the
	Windows 64 SDK.

	* stlport/cstdio: Add vsnprintf definition which is missing in Windows
	64 SDK.

	* stlport/exception: Add flexibility for definition of vendor terminate
	and uncaught_exception function namespace. Can now be defined independantly
	of the unexpected_exception namespace.

	* src/dll_main.cpp: Removed explicit turn off of optimization for Microsoft
	compilers after .Net 2003. There were no comment to explain why optimizations
	were turned off so I guess it was a compiler bug. .Net 2003 being a major
	new version I hope this bug has vanish with this version.

	* src/fstream.cpp: Removed static assertion for windows file handle to be 32
	bits. Under Windows 64, even if the API is still 32 bits handles are still
	defined as void*. We will see when code will run under a real Windows 64 platform
	if it is a problem.

	* stlport/config/stl_msvc.h: Add configuration for Windows 64 Platform SDK.
	Expecially add automatic link to bufferoverflowU.lib to avoid modification
	of STLport build system and STLport users projects.

2005-08-06  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr@island...>

	* src/c_locale_glibc/c_locale_glibc2.c: add explicit type conversion
	to avoid warnings on 64-bits platforms; thanks Thomas Kho and
	Karol Szkudlarek for report.

2005-08-05  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_valarray.h: Add missing _debug.h header inclusion for
	_STLP_ASSERT macro definition.

	* stlport/stl/debug/_hashtable.h: Fix typo in hashtable move constructor.
	Thanks arabesc report.

2005-08-05  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr@island...>

	* doc/FAQ: some words about cross-compilation.

2005-08-04  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_hashtable.c: Fix erase(range) implementation thanks
	arabesc.

	* test/unit/hash_test.cpp: Add new test for previous fix.

2005-08-04  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr@island...>

	* stlport/csetjmp: sometimes, if native setjmp.h was included first,
	the setjmp functions situated in global namespace, not in vendor's
	std. This may confuse following csetjmp.

	* test/unit/setjmp_header_test2.cpp: test for this.

	* build/test/unit/Makefile.inc: ditto.

2005-08-03  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* INSTALL document updated to signal no longer support of the
	'wrapper' mode.

2005-08-02  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr@island...>

	* stlport/stl_user_config.h, stlport/stl/_site_config.h:
	fix some obsolete comments.

2005-07-31  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr@island...>

	* test/unit/math_aux.h, cmath_test.cpp: are_equals moved into
	math_aux.h to reuse in other tests.

	* test/unit/sstream_test.cpp: check input to float, inspired by
	Jeff Williams.

2005-07-27  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/iomanip, stl/_algo.h: Removed some persistent occurences
	of __in and __out keywords reserved by Microsoft.

	* stlport/stl/_pthread_alloc.c: Fix annoying warning reported by gcc.

	* stlport/config/stl_msvc.h: Fix _STLP_VENDOR_UNEXPECTED_STD macro
	definition to empty rather than '1'. Could have produce a compilation
	error with compilers like Intel C++ used with the VC6 native Standard
	library.

	* stlport/queue, stl/_ctraits_fns.h, _hashtable.h, _numeric.h, _string.h
	_tree.h: Fix macro guards used to avoid inclusion of _function.h or
	_function_base.h or functional thanks Dinesh Monga report.

2005-07-26  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr@island...>

	* doc/FAQ: description of pseudo-leaks, thanks Michael Fink.

	* STLport (repository): STLport 5.0 RC4

2005-07-25  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/config/stl_evc.h: Move _DEBUG definition fix up before
	stl_msvc.h inclusion to have correct library link automatically.
	Thanks Michael Fink.

2005-07-24  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_string.c, _rope.c: Add instanciation of npos for all
	compilers thanks Simon.

	* test/unit/string_test.cpp: Add creation of a reference to string::npos
	to force compiler to generate memory for it. Used to reveal a link error.

	* test/unit/cppunit/cppunit_mini.h: Removed redondant semi column in 
	CPPUNIT_TEST_SUITE_REGISTRATION macro definition.

	* stlport/config/stl_msvc.h, stl_intel.h: Concidering that compilers
	emulating MSVC compilers use the same native Standard Library headers
	macros _STLP_NEW_PLATFORM_SDK and _STLP_NO_VENDOR_STDLIB_L has been moved
	outside the _STLP_MSVC scope. _STLP_GLOBAL_NEW_HANDLER is now defined
	only for Intel compiler versions before 9.0.

	* stlport/cstdlib, stl/_cmath.h: Because of the previous remark about
	emulators of MSVC using MSVC headers, macro checks for global definition
	of C math functions has been changed from _STLP_MSVC to _MSC_VER. 

2005-07-23  Michael Fink  <vividos@users.sourceforge...>

	* test/unit/locale_test.cpp: Added creating locale pointer in
	test_supported_locale() when no exception handling is available.

	* src/stlport.rc: Added version info defines when not available through
	windows.h. Happens on evc3 MIPS and evc3 SH3.

2005-07-23  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_string_sum.h: Fix missing return statement in a compare
	method.

2005-07-22  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_algo.c: Fix search_n implementation for random access
	iterator thanks Jim Xochellis

	* test/unit/algo_test.cpp: Add test case for the previous bug thanks
	Michael Fink.

	* src/num_get_float.cpp: Fix gcc Mingwin and Cygwin special version with
	building with -O2 option.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/gcc.mak: Add -D_REENTRANT definition for cygwin and
	-mthreads for mingwin platform to make STLport thread safe like under the
	other supported platforms.

2005-06-30  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr@island...>

	* stlport/wchar.h, src/c_locale.c, stlport/stl/_threads.h: fix Netware
	wcs... functions.

2005-06-30  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_rope.h, _rope.c: Duplicate basic_string::npos definition code
	in rope implementation to use a "Standard" static const npos definition when
	possible depending on the compiler features. Thanks caldwed report.

2005-06-30  Michael Fink  <vividos@users.sourceforge...>

	* stlport/cstdlib, stdlib.h: Fixed issue with including stdlib.h after
	setjmp.h; fix from 2005-06-23 wasn't solving the problem.

2005-06-28  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_hash_func.h: For MSVC .Net compiler we grant the hash<size_t>
	specialization rather than the hash<unsigned int> one to avoid 64 bits
	warnings when instanciating a hashed container with the size_t key.

	* stlport/stl/_istream_iterator.h: Modify istream_iterator implementation
	to avoid the default read from the istream even if the istream_iterator
	instance is not used.

	* test/unit/istmit_test.cpp: Add many tests for the copy_n/istream_iterator
	combination. Those tests are no active for the moment as they are failing,
	will be fixed after 5.0 release.

	* build/test/unit/nmake-vc-common.mak: Tests are no more built with the
	_STLP_NO_CUSTOM_IO option, see reason below.

	* test/unit/fstream_test.cpp: Add custom_facet test to check that STLport
	support instanciation of basic_fstream with something else that the std::char_traits
	For the moment the test fail when we try to use the stream for I/O operations
	should be fixed after 5.0 release.

2005-06-27  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* src/locale_impl.cpp: Fix locale implementation to avoid to call facet
	destructor when user explicitely required not to do so.

	* stlport/stl/_fstream.c: Fix _M_setup_codecvt method implementation to avoid
	a bad_cast exception on basic_filebuf construction. At this point the locale
	used to instanciate it is the classic locale that might not have the necessary
	codecvt facet. The user is then force to call imbue after basic_filebuf
	construction otherwise I/O operations will fail. When imbue is invoked, if
	the locale still do not have the necesary facet, the stream is put in the fail
	state. Thanks Alexander Pototskiy

2005-06-26  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_config_compat.h: Add _STLP_OWN_IOSTREAMS macro for backward
	compatibility with library checking it.

2005-06-23  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* src/complex.cpp, complex_trig.cpp, complex_exp.cpp: Removed code
	duplication between float, double and long double version thanks to
	some template functions. Thanks an Ulrich Eckhardt idear.

	* stlport/cstdlib, stl/stdlib.h: Michael Fink patch to avoid setjmp.h
	inclusion problem as stdlib.h contains a setjmp macro definition.

	* test/eh/main.cpp: Redirection of std::cout and std::cerr for WinCE
	thanks Michael Fink

	* stlport/config/stl_evc.h: Restore long double support for WinCE, there
	is just no *l math functions. Only define _STLP_NATIVE_INCLUDE_PATH
	if not already defined, giving the user a chance to override the defaults
	for yet unknown SDKs. Thanks Michael Fink and Ulrich Eckhardt.

	* build/Makefiles/nmake/evc3.mak, evc4.mak: removed unneeded set of CC
	for SHx; already done by setup batch. Thanks Michael Fink. 

2005-06-21  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_ios.h, _ios_base.h, _num_get.c, _num_put.c, _complex.c,
	_istream.c, _time_facets.c: Fix cast expression for the cached facets,
	C casts replaced by static_cast and const added when missing.
	Thanks Oliver Stoeneberg report.

	* test/unit/unary.h: Replaced old STLport with new style ones. Get sqrt
	function in global namespace rather than forcing use of the one in std
	namespace, avoids ambiguity with VC6.

	* test/unit/resolve_name.cpp: Add _STLP_DO_IMPORT_CSTD_FUNCTIONS definition
	at the top of it to force import of C symbols in std even for limited
	compilers like VC6.

	* stlport/stl/_valarray.h: Add global namespace scope to C function calls
	to avoid VC6 ambiguity problem.

2005-06-20  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/config/stl_gcc.h: Fix gcc 3.4.4 detection under cygwin thanks
	Ulrich Eckhardt report.

	* stlport/stl/c_locale.h: Fix _Locale_mask_t definition for Mingwin.

	* src/c_locale_win32/c_locale_win32.c: Add static assertion to check
	_Locale_mask_t size.

	* src/complex_exp.cpp: Replaced complex log10 function static variables
	with global constant, avoid multithreaded init problem. Thanks Ulrich
	Eckhardt report.

2005-06-17  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_alloc.h: Add initialization of the memory buffer in
	allocator::allocate function and reset in allocator::deallocate to
	the _STLP_SHRED_BYTE motif when _STLP_DEBUG_UNINITIALIZED is defined
	to help track missing initialization issue.

	* src/dll_main.cpp: Removed now useless _Node_alloc_helper class.

	* stlport/stl/_alloc.c: Add complete cleanup of the __node_alloc static
	datas in the _S_chunk_dealloc method, this is important if the clean up
	occur before STLport shared lib is unloaded.

	* stlport/stl/_alloc.c: Add a static instance of __node_alloc_cleaner in the
	_S_alloc_call method and change init number of allocation to 1 to force
	release of memory pool only on shared library unload.

2005-06-11  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/cstdlib, stl/_cmath.h: Add _STLP_NO_CSTD_FUNCTION_IMPORTS macro
	check before import of global C functions in STLport namespace. Required
	for VC6 compiler to avoid ambiguity issue.

	* src/complex.cpp, complex_epx.cpp, complex_trig.cpp: Scope math function
	call with the global namespace to avoid VC6 ambiguity issue. It is safe
	for the other compilers as STLport do define those function in global
	namespace.

2005-06-10  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/c_locale.h: Fix Cygwin configuration, separate alpha mask
	from lower and upper one to avoid all lower character to also be upper
	and opposite.

	* src/ctype.cpp: Add static assertion to detect platform where
	alpha = lower | upper which is wrong for STLport use.

2005-06-10  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_hashtable.c: Fix max_load_factor management, Standard says
	that load_factor <= max_load_factor and not <; the function detecting need
	for rehash used to launch one even if the number of bucket do not change which
	was counter performant. Fix the _M_insert_noresize method that was breaking
	element order inserting elements in the middle of 2 equal elements.
	Thanks Dieter Freismuth report.

	* stlport/config/stl_gcc.h: Fix relative include path for latest gcc cygwin
	package.

2005-06-10  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr@island...>

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/mwccnlm.mak: fix compiler version collection.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/netware/extern.mak: fix useful paths.

	* src/c_locale.c: put here wrappers for some wfuncs, due to bogus
	system libs in Netware.

	* stlport/cwchar: use STLport's wchar.h to take wchar_t/wint_t for
	Netware.

	* stlport/wchar.h: use correct C declaration of some wfuncs, thanks
	again to ugly Netware libs.

	* stlport/ciso646, stlport/iso646.h, stlport/wctype.h: headers absent
	for Novell Netware.

	* stlport/cwctype: Metrowerks define __MSL__, but we don't use MSL libs
	if we have STLport for Netware.

	* stlport/cstdlib: div function from Novell Netware clib and libc lead to
	system crash.

2005-06-08  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* build/test/unit: Removed references to the now useless CPPUNIT_MINI
	macro.

	* test/unit/type_traits_test.cpp: Add new test case for trivial destructor
	detection.

	* stlport/stl/_fstream.h: Add missing basic_fstream construction from a
	Win32 file handle, was already done for basic_ifstream and basic_ofstream,
	thanks Alex Cosealin report.

2005-06-07  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* build/test/unit/Makefile.inc: Fix syntax error at last line.

2005-06-06  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr@island...>

	Novell NetWare platform [references to root of MW headers/libs and to Novell's
	SDK headers/libs].

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/mwccnlm.mak: fixes for Metrowerk/NetWare.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/app/mwccnlm.mak: idem.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/netware/extern.mak: idem.

	* build/lib/mwccnlm.mak: idem.

	* build/test/unit/mwccnlm.mak: idem.

2005-06-03  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* test/unit/locale_test.cpp: Remove the very platform dependent LColl
	class that was listing supported locales. STLport already do so and
	report it using a runtime_error exception when not supported. When
	compiler do not support exception only the C locale is checked.

	* build/Makefiles/nmake: Patches from Michael Fink to
	  - check platform before linking to crtrtti.lib
	  - check right configuration when using a nmake-evc?.mak file
	  - update STATUS file.

2005-06-02  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* src/c_locale_win32/c_locale_win32.c: Add workaround for a Windows PSDK bug
	concerning currency international symbol, the separation character is missing.

	* src/locale_impl.h, locale_impl.cpp: Fix implementation to make classic locale
	implementation a normal instance that is released when the counter reach 0, the
	only difference is that no delete is performed on this instance. Idem for classic
	locale implementation facets.

	* stlport/cwctype: And _GLIBCPP_USE_WCHAR_T check when using GLibC as in this
	case wide char functions are not imported in std and must be imported from the
	global namespace.

2005-06-01  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* src/locale_impl.h, locale_impl.cpp: Change classic locale initialization
	implementation for limited compiler like MSVC6.

2005-06-01  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr@island...>

	* stlport/stl/c_locale.h: check gcc on MacOS X. Patch by Zdenek Nemec

	* build/Makefiles/nmake/evc3.mak, evc4.mak, targets.mak:
	support SH3/SH4 platform. Patch by Michael Fink.

	* build/Makefiles/nmake/app/evc3.mak, evc4.mak: ditto.

	* build/Makefiles/nmake/lib/evc3.mak, evc4.mak: ditto.

	* build/lib/configure.bat, src/stlport.rc: ditto.

2005-05-30  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* src/locale_impl.h, locale_impl.cpp, stlport/stl/_locale.h: An other pass
	throught the classic locale initialization. Now all needed static variables
	are in _Locale_impl::make_classic_locale method. Removed useless _Stl_aligned_buffer
	union use in this locale initialization. Removed now useless _Locale_impl::free_classic_locale
	method.

2005-05-30  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr@island...>

	* stlport/stl/_windows.h: worry about Windows CE when check Interlocked
	API for MIPS. Patch by Michael Fink.

	* build/lib/configure.bat: remove the -p option by autodetecting platform.
	Patch by Michael Fink.

	* build/Makefiles/nmake/evc3.mak, evc4.mak: corrects the evc4 makefiles
	to always use the /GF switch [string pooling]. Patch by Michael Fink.

	* doc/README.evc3, doc/README.evc4: reflect changes above.
	Patch by Michael Fink.

	* stlport/errno.h, stlport/time.h: when building for evc, including
	errno.h and time.h often outputs the message in the #pragma statement
	that including this file won't include the native one, since there is no
	native include file. Now the text is only output when not building the library
	and when the file is included directly, not via another STLport header file.
	[Patch by Michael Fink.]

2005-05-29  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* test/unit/locale_test.cpp: Add opendir returned value when listing
	installed locale under linux.

2005-05-27  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* src/locale_impl.cpp: Add an initialization segment specification to make
	global static variable ios_base::Init instance initialization prioritized
	compare to STLport static global variable. iostreams like cout can be used
	in global static variable initialization.

2005-05-26  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* build/Makefiles/nmake/evc4.mak: Patch from Ulrich Eckhardt to use CC
	environment variable defined by WCE*.bat script rather than redefining
	it.

	* src/locale.cpp, locale_impl.cpp, locale_catalog.cpp: New pass to move
	static global variable in function to make initialization order clear.

2005-05-25  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/ciso646: Creation of this missing C++ standard header STLport
	wrapper.

	* stlport/stl/_istream.h, _num_get.c, _algo.c, _monetary.c, _time_facets.h,
	_time_facets.c: Replaced occurences of __in and __out reserved by Microsoft.

2005-05-24  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/headers: Patch from Michael Fink to avoid inclusion of headers
	not available under evc3.

	* test/unit/*_header_test.cpp: Fix tests for no iostreams mode.

	* src/locale_impl.cpp, locale_impl.cpp: Modify implementation to force 
	correct initialization order of static instances.

	* stlport/strstream: Add _ioserr.h file to avoid inclusion in no iostreams
	mode.

2005-05-23  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr@island...>

	* stlport/stl/_config.h: detect endianness for Intel's 64bit Pentium and
	Itanium processors. Thanks Albrecht Fritzsche for contribution.

2005-05-20  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* build/test/eh: Patch from Michael Fink to add EVC4 support for this test
	suite.

	* src/fstream.cpp: Use of Wlodek Szafran implementation for the _Filebuf_base::_M_read
	method which is more performant than the previous one.

	* test/unit/fstream_test.cpp: Add of a test for the special Win32 file format.

	* test/unit: Add of many test to check Standard C/C++ headers independancy
	and correct C header implementation.

2005-05-18  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* src/fstream.cpp: Fix buffer overflow in _Filebuf_base::_M_read method
	for the Win32 platform implementation thanks Wlodek Szafran report.

	* src/c_locale_dummy/c_locale_dummy.c: Patch from Michael Fink for wrong C
	prototype.

2005-05-17  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr@island...>

	* test/unit/locale_test.cpp: some fixes in moneypunct test, related
	to international currency format; some problems still remains, due to
	unclear specifications---if international currency 3-chars abbreviation
	used in suffix form, additional space will be appended
	['1 234.56 RUR ']. This is due to intl_fmp.curr_symbol() == "RUR ",
	and the last is conform to OpenGroup spec.

2005-05-16  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr@island...>

	* src/c_locale_stub.cpp: "stub" implemntation moved into
	c_locale_dummy/c_locale_dummy.c, this file removed

	* src/c_locale.c: include c_locale_dummy/c_locale_dummy.c, in case of
	no real locale implementation.

	* src/c_locale_dummy/c_locale_dummy.c: This is a "stub" implementation
	of the "c_locale.h" interface, intended for operating systems where
	we have not yet written a real implementation. A C++ library using
	this stub implementation is still standard-conforming, since
	the C++ standard does not require that any locales other
	than "C" be supported.

	* build/lib/Makefile.inc: src/c_locale_stub.cpp removed.

	* src/facets_by_name.cpp: add comments in the _Init_monetary_formats.

	* src/c_locale_glibc/c_locale_glibc2.c: annotate some monetary-related
	functions.

2005-05-14  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr@island...>

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/aCC.mak: HP's aCC compiler and HP-UX os support.
	This isn't really checked and should be fixed on real system.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/app/aCC.mak, gmake/lib/aCC.mak: ditto.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/hp-ux/extern.mak, lib.mak: ditto.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/hp-ux/rules-install-so.mak, rules-so.mak: ditto.

	* build/lib/aCC.mak: ditto.

	* build/test/unit/aCC.mak: ditto.

	* build/test/unit/gcc.mak: remove dbg-shared tag from default build;
	if you need unit tests with debug info and without _STLP_DEBUG, make this
	tag explicitly.

2005-05-14  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_config.h, _config_compat_post.h, _cwchar.h, _epilog.h:
	Patch from Albrecht Fritzsche to remove C++ comment from files accessible
	by a pure C compiler.

	* stlport/stl/c_locale.h: idem.

	* src/c_locale.h, c_locale_glibc/c_locale_glibc2.h: idem.

	* src/gcc_localeinfo.h, c_locale_win32/c_locale_win32.c: idem.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/gcc.mak: Add the -ansi option to the C compiler
	command to know if any regression occur concerning use of C++ comment
	in C files.

2005-05-13  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* src/c_locale_win32/c_locale_win32.c: Improve the locale name recognition
	system to be more unix compliant. Now you can pass locale name like
	lang_country[.codepage] with lang being one of the ISO 639 values and
	country one of the ISO 3166 ones.

	* test/unit/locale_test.cpp: Add a test case for the ctype facet.

	* test/unit/locale_test.cpp: Now list all the installed locales under
	Win32 to test more locale than the simple french one.

	* stlport/config/stl_msvc.h: Removed _WINDLL macro check when trying
	to guess what type of library (dynamic/static) the STLport user want
	to link with. _WINDLL is defined when generating a dll but it do not
	imply anything on the user wish.

	* src/ctype.cpp: Improve the ctype::scan_is method, you can now scan
	for a character conforming to several ctype_base::mask and not only to one.

	* src/ctype.cpp: Idem previous for ctype::scan_not which returns the first
	character that do not conform to any of the passed mask.

	* test/eh: Restore exception handling test suite. Removed some equality
	tests that is no more valid for hash containers, this kind of test
	is better in the unit tests. Add makefiles for MSVC compilers.

	* stlport/stl/_tree.c: Fix _M_insert method that was leaking in case of
	exception thrown by the comparison operator, reported by eh tests.

2005-05-09  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_ctype.h, src/ctype.cpp: Reenforce data encapsulation of the
	ctype<char> template specialization class. class static arrays
	_S_upper, _S_lower, _S_classic_table removed from the definition and hiden
	in the .cpp file.

	* src/dll_main.cpp: Change _STLP_UNIX macro check in _STLP_PTHREADS check
	as per thread allocator is only supported if the Posix pthread API is used,
	thanks a Albrecht Fritzsche remarked.

2005-05-07  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/config/stl_gcc.h: Patch from John Smith for Mac OS X support.

	* test/unit/locale_test.cpp: Idem previous.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/cygming/lib.mak, sys.mak: Import lib extension
	change from .lib to .dll.a for Mingw like under Cygwin. ld linker
	looks for .dll.a before .lib, avoid conflict with Cygwin lib.

2005-05-07  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr@island...>

	* stlport/errno.h: use C++ 'using' construction only for C++. Thanks Gary.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/lib/gcc.mak: option for libname for Darwin.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/app/mwccnlm.mak: build for Novell NetWare 5
	with MetroWerks 7 and 8 compilers.

	* stlport/stl/_config.h, _fstream.h, _hashtable.c, _sstream.c: ditto

	* stlport/stl/_threads.h, c_locale.h, char_traits.h: ditto

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/sysid.mak: treat mwccnlm as cross-compiler,
	set correct TARGET_OS and OS-related macros.

	* stlport/stl/_valarray.h: remove exhaustive this->.

2005-05-04  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/config/stl_msvc.h: Change configuration for MSVC .Net 2003 and
	2005 that seems to have a bug in the namespace management.

	* stlport/stdlib.h: Add errno.h inclusion from this file for gcc mingw
	as this	compiler version do define errno macro in stdlib.h as MSVC do.

2005-05-03  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl_user_config.h, stl/_site_config.h, config/stl_gcc.h, _prolog.h,
	_epilog.h: Use strict Ansi C comments (/**/) for headers accessible thought 
	the STLport C headers.

	* stlport/C headers: Cleaned from C++ style comments.

2005-05-02  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* build/Makefiles/nmake/vc-common.mak: Restore of LDFLAGS_A_REL introduce
	the 2004-10-30 and lost the 2005-04-16, it avoids warning due to use
	of the whole program optimization with VC.Net 2003 and 2005.

	* stlport/stl/_string_io.c: Modification of the basic_string i/o operators
	in the way it deals with the size_type and streamsize difference; it is
	equivalent with the former one but do not generate warning with gcc
	(mingwin).

	* stlport/stddef.h, stdlib.h, errno.h: Fix issue under MSVC compilers where
	native stdlib.h and stddef.h are defining errno macro without including
	errno.h forbiding STLport to do so. Now errno.h will report this problem with
	an explicit #error.

	* test/unit/test_errno.cpp: Improvement of the test to reveal the previous
	issue.

2005-05-02  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr@island...>

	* makesystem (repository): restore experimental support of MetroWerks
	compiler for NetWare, with help of GNU make and Cygwin environment.

2005-04-29  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_time_facets.c: gcc warnings reveal that we were missing some
	ctype::widen method call to compare things like month or day names.
	Also simplified implementation of the __match and __get_formatted_time that
	do not really need all the template parameters passed to it.

	* stlport/stl/_num_put.c: Add a cast to make call to the function min more
	clear, it will perhaps help EVC++ builds correctly.

	* src/strstream.cpp, stlport/stl/_sstream.c: Removed static assertion
	replaced by modified implementation that takes into account the difference
	between size_t and streamsize.

2005-04-28  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* test/unit/limits_test.cpp: Improve integral types limit test for type
	of unknown sign. In this case we check the min value of this integral type,
	if 0 the type is unsigned. Moreover we check, except for the bool type,
	the sign of -1 cast to the integral type, bool is a special type that
	generate warning when built from -1 (MSVC).

	* src/ctype.cpp: Creation of a small helper structure to check the validity
	of a wchar_t value used as an index. This helper struct takes into account
	the compiler representation of the wchar_t type, is it a sign type or not.
	This helper avoids warning when wchar_t is unsigned.

	* src/num_get.cpp: Removed unused _Initialize_get_digit function and
	associated narrow_digits and narrow_xdigits arrays.

2005-04-28  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr@island...>

	* stlport/stl/_sstream.h, _num_put.c: __in replaced by __imode, __out

	* using/iosfwd.h, stlport/strstream.h, stl/_rope.h, _rope.c, _complex.h: Removed 
	references to the _STLP_USE_NEW_IOSTREAMS macro, STLport only support "new"
	iostreams.

	max are not defined as macros.

	* test/fstream_test.cpp: Add check in creation of test_file.txt
	as following tests depends on its content.

	* src/strstream.cpp, stdio_streambuf.cpp: Fix potential issue because of
	the difference between streamsize and size_t of ptrdiff_t.
	Add static assertion to clearly specify how streamsize must be to have
	a correct behavior.

	* stlport/stl/_num_put.c, _num_get.c, _fstream.c, _moneraty.c: ditto.

	* src/ctype.cpp: Restore check on wchar_t positivity as according

	* src/c_locale_win32/c_locale_win32.c: Add some cast to remove warnings.

	* stlport/stl/_moneraty.c: Fix __witdh definition to use streamsize rather
	than size_t to avoid warnings.

2005-04-25  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr@island...>

	* build/test/gcc.mak: workaround for [bug?] gmake, that sometimes lose

	which fail when sizeof(streamsize) > sizeof(ptrdiff_t).
	See 2005-04-21 Petr report.

	* test/unit/: Replaced all _STLP_NO_IOSTREAMS occurences with the STLport
	internal equivalent _STLP_USE_NO_IOSTREAMS. The first one is defined
	by the client while the second depends on the first and on the compiler
	abilities, makes the unit tests more portable.

	* stlport/stl/_cmath.h: Fix for Intel C++ compiler that also have all
	C math functions in global namespace.

2005-04-21  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	a macro that is different under Win32 and Win64.

2005-04-21  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr@island...>

	* test/unit/sstream_test.cpp, fstream_test.cpp: integral type for

	* stlport/stl/_list.h, _slist.h: Add missing get_allocator() call when
	building temporary list or slist instances in insert methods.

2005-04-12  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr@island...>

	* stlport/errno.h: solution 2005-04-12 not useful. Simplified schema,

	for some commpilers (gcc mingwin).

2005-04-07  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* build/lib/nmake-vc-common.mak: Removed useless add of STLport/lib to 
	library paths when building STLport lib.

	install	directory, all the job is done by the vcvcars32.bat script that sets
	the LIB env variable to the real MSVC install directory.

	* test/unit/unordered_test.cpp, locale_test.cpp: Removed gcc mingw warnings.

	* build/Makefiles/nmake/icl.mak, app/icl.mak, lib/icl.mak: Removed the

	In addition to being useless Intel compiler emit compilation error about it.

2005-04-06  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr@island...>

	* test/unit/cppunit/test_main.cpp: windows.h required here
	[see 2005-04-04; patch by Michael Fink].

	* stlport/stl/_istream.h: __is replaced by __istr, due
	to MS privatize __is.

	* stlport/stl/_num_get.h: __in replaced by __ii, due to MS

	and time.h headers [patch by Michael Fink].

	* stl_evc.h, _windows.h, test_main.cpp: workaround to not include
	<windows.h> in STLport headers (it is still needed for building
	the lib and the unit tests, but that should be no problem).
	Occurences of GetCurrentProcess() used in _STLP_ABORT were replaced
	with the result of the inline function, which returns a pseudo-
	HANDLE value. [patch by Michael Fink]

	* cwchar, wchar.h, stl/_cwchar.h: fix access to mbstate and wint_t
	for FreeBSD.

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/sysid.mak, app/gcc.mak, lib/gcc.mak:

	header.

	* build/test/eh: build eh tests again.

	* test/eh/LeakCheck.h, TestClass.cpp, TestClass.h: fix and clear.

2005-03-29  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr@island...>

	* build/Makefiles/gmake/app/rules.mak, freebsd/rules-so.mak,
	linux/rules-so.mak, openbsd/rules-so.mak, sunos/rules-so.mak:

	soon as a simple compiler warning or error occur. Those messages are
	template instanciation context of previous disabled warning. Warning message
	are correctly disable but template instanciation context is kept until
	an enable warning or an error happen. There is nothing to do against that
	at STLport level except fixing or disabling warnings for unit tests build.

	cctype include removed from _string.h. _string_hash.h also moved from
	_string.h to string for consistency.

	* stlport/stl/_complex.c: Add of the _string_io.h header include that
	was missing after string include schema modification.

	* stlport/stl/_string_base.h, _string.h: basic_string move traits STLport

	of the default STLport node_allocator. Supported by the Win32 platform
	for the moment.

	* src/ios.cpp, locale.cpp, locale_impl.cpp: use of atomic operations
	under Win32 platform rather than using synchronisation primitives.

	* stlport/stl/_tree.h, _map.h, _set.h: creation of the erase_unique and
	equal_range_unique methods to use the unicity information of the map and
	set containers in binary tree searches.

	* src/explore/Makefiles/gmake/app/gcc.mak: use -fPIC for gcc 2.95.x when build
	application---this is a workaround for bug with running code in static constructors.

	* stlport/config/stl_gcc.h, stlport/stl/_config.h: force usage of mutex instead
	of spinlock for gcc 2.95.x, due to problems with initialization of statics.
	Initialization of mutex has variant with structure filling, while for spinlock
	initialization function call required.

	* test/unit/locale_test.cpp: avoid static object for gcc 2.95.x, due to problems
	with initialization of statics.

	process.

2004-10-25  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_config.h: Introduction of the _STLP_DONT_USE_EXCEPTIONS which 
	means that the client do not want to use the C++ exception feature. It is
	different from the _STLP_NO_EXCEPTIONS which means that the compiler do not
	support exceptions at all. The distinction is important for some macros definition.

	* test/unit: Modification of the _STLP_NO_EXCEPTIONS test to the more general
	_STLP_USE_EXCEPTION macro.

	* stlport/stl/_ios_base.h, src/ios.cpp: rollback of the modifications of the
	2004-10-24.

	* stlport/config/stl_msvc.h, stl_gcc.h: Those 2 compilers have a exception

	* test/unit/sstream_test.cpp, fstream_test.cpp: Fix of the tests on streambuf 
	throwing exception for platform with no exception support.

	* stl/_string.h: Add of the missing compare methods on the basic_string 
	implementation used by compilers supporting template methods thanks Patrick
	Bennett report.

	* stlport/stl/debug/_vector.h, _deque.h: Add check on the insert range method, 
	the inserted can not be pointing to the this instance where the insertion occur.

2004-10-13  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr@island...>

	namespace when users cannot use the std namespace.

2004-10-07  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_slist.h: ditto.

2004-10-06  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_rope.h, _rope.c: Code review, use of general STLport tools rather

	test/unit tests instead; all tests from test/regression was moved in test/unit,
	sometimes in redesigned form.

2004-09-29  Francois Dumont  <dums@stlport...>

	* stlport/stl/_string_io.c: Removal of the native library specific calls of 
	use_facet, only the STLport standard one is used.

	* stlport/stl/_alloc.h, _alloc.c, src/dll_main.cpp: Implementation of a clean

	a lot of restrictions in usage and frequently lead to hard recognized problems.
	Tonns of *_STREAMS macro replaced by _STLP_USE_NO_IOSTREAMS or _STLP_NO_IOSTREAMS
	as configuration macro; *NATIVE_STRING macro removed by the same reasons.

2004-09-27  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr@island...>

	* test/unit/gcc.mak: fix stlport library name for STLP_DEBUG mode for Solaris,
	thanks for separate namespaces in normal and STLP_DEBUG mode, see record
	2004-09-10 below.

2004-09-24  Francois Dumont  <dums@...>

	* stlport/config/stl_gcc.h: Fix of the relative include path used to access the
	native gcc headers. Before version 3.4.0 the 0 patch level was not part of the 
	include	path.

	* stlport/stl/type_traits.h, _vector.h, _algobase.h, _construct.h: Removal
	of the __action_on_move type traits replaced by a generalization of the 
	already existing __move_traits.

	* test/unit/mvctor_test.cpp: New test case for the __move_traits feature.

2004-09-24  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr@island...>

	* src/explore/Makefiles/gmake/app/gcc.mak: ditto.

	* src/explore/Makefiles/gmake/lib/gcc.mak: ditto.

	* stlport/cmath: fix some math calls for Solaris.

	* test/unit/list_test.cpp: add illustration for list iterator/reverse_iterator questions.

	* src/explore/Makefiles/gmake/unix/lib.mak: moved from linux/lib.mak, as
	common rules for all *nixes.

	* src/explore/Makefiles/gmake/linux/lib.mak: use common for all *nixes rules
	in unix/lib.mak.

	* src/explore/Makefiles/gmake/openbsd/lib.mak: ditto.

	* src/explore/Makefiles/gmake/sunos/lib.mak: ditto.

	* src/explore/Makefiles/gmake/unix/lib.mak, test/unit/gcc.mak: changed library name;
	libraries now named as libstlport, libstlportg, libstlportstlg for optimized, with
	debug symbols, and with debug symbols and _STLP_DEBUG mode libraries respectivly.

2004-09-21  Francois Dumont  <dums@...>

	* stlport/stl/debug: Modification of the __check_range class in the more general
	__check_construct. Now it also checks for null pointers in the string interface.

	compilers thanks Michael Fink

2004-09-20  Francois Dumont  <dums@...>

	* src/explore/Makefiles/gmake/cygwin, mingw: Build configuration files merges
	within a single build system: cygming. Future portage of STLport for compilers
	using the GNU tools will be available from both systems. Removal of the vc6 build
	under cygwin, for mono-platform compilers we support only one build system.

	* stlport/stl/_vector.h: Modification of the destructor implementation to destroyed
	object instances in a reverse order taking advantage of the way elements are
	normaly added to this container.

2004-09-16  Francois Dumont  <dums@...>

	* test/unit/cppunit/cppunit_mini.h, cppunit_proxy.h: Adaptation of the CPPUNIT
	framework to take care of the exception as failures thanks Zdenek Nemec

	* stlport/config/stl_msvc.h, stl_bc.h, stl_mwerks.h, stlport/stl_user_config.h:
	Removal of the non intuitive and difficult to maintain automatic linking feature.

	* Fixing of the locale implementation mecanism. Classic locale implementation is
	also managed by a reference counter to be sure when it is possible to release
	the associated ressources. Fix of a missing locale impl ref counter decrement
	in the template locale constructor taking a facet, it was a possible source of
	memory leak . Addition of a static object within locale_impl.cpp in 
	_STLP_LEAKS_PEDANTIC mode to decrement the global locale impl ref counter when 
	STLport library is unloaded. Addition of all the missing classic locale facets
	destructor in free_classic_locale.

	* src/locale_catalog.cpp: The locale by name constructor checks the "C" name
	to simply copy (increment the ref counter) the classic locale implementation 
	rather than instanciating a new one.

2004-09-15  Francois Dumont  <dums@...>

	* stlport/stl/_list.c: Modification of the _S_sort implementation, the __carry 
	list instance is created using the __that allocator instance copy to be more
	allocator friendly.

	compiler thanks Charlemagne.

2004-09-10  Francois Dumont  <dums@...>

	* stlport/stl/_config.h: The new official namespace is now stlp_std. _STL is
	just an alias. STLPORT macro still contains the STLport std namespace equivalent.
	Moreover in _STLP_DEBUG mode, which is not binary compatible with the release
	or debug mode, the namespace is stlpd_std to generate link error rather
	than runtime crash.

2004-09-09  Francois Dumont  <dums@...>

	* stlport/stl/_config.h: _STLP_DONT_USE_NESTED_TCLASS_THROUGHT_TPARAM 
	renamed to the more intuitive _STLP_DONT_SUPPORT_REBIND_MEMBER_TEMPLATE.

	* stlport/stl/_config.h: Introduction of a new namespace stlp_private
	defined in the global namespace. Everything that is STLport implementation
	details should be in this namespace to avoid polution of the std namespace.

	* stlport/stl/_iterator_base.h: Modification of the macro used to create
	iterator traits for all tree and hashtable based containers to move it in
	the stlp_private namespace rather than defining it as nested struct, limits
	the symbol size.

2004-09-08  Francois Dumont  <dums@...>

	* test/unit/fstream_test.cpp: restauration of the test added by Petr
	the 2004-09-03, it is finaly a different test from the one in sstream_test.cpp.
	Some more checks have also been integrated.

	* stlport/stl/_ostream.c: New fix of the _M_unbuffured_copy method that was
	still bugged in case of a throwing output streambuf, detected thanks to the
	test case.

2004-09-07  Francois Dumont  <dums@...>

	* stlport/config/stl_msvc.h: Add defines of the _STLP_USE_STATIC_LIB
	or _STLP_USE_DYNAMIC_LIB depending on the current kind of build.

	* stlport/stl/_streambuf.h, _streambug.c: Fix an unresolved symbol 
	problem for MSVC6 (and before?) when STLport is used as a static library.

2004-09-06  Francois Dumont  <dums@...>

	* test/unit/nmake-evc-common.mak: Use of the dynamic runtime for the
	*-shared rules rather than the previous static thanks Michael Fink.

	* test/unit/nmake-evc*.mak: end of build code factorisation, use of 
	nmake-evc-common.mak within all makefiles thanks Michael Fink.

	* test/unit/locale_test.cpp: Application of a patch from Michael Fink
	to check the "C" locale on all platforms. Fix of the money_get_put test
	case for the "C" locale.

2004-09-05  Francois Dumont  <dums@...>

	* stlport/stl/_string_hash.h: Performance improvement, multiplication
	replaced by shift operations thanks Greg S.

	* stlport/config/stl_wince_4.h: removed, never used, stl_evc.h has been 
	prefered.

	* test/unit/string_test.cpp: addition of a new test short_string_optim_bug
	to check for a compiler bugs making the short string optim invalid thanks
	Michael Fink.

	* stlport/config/stl_evc.h: Deactivation of the short string optimization
	because of a compiler bug thanks Michael Fink.

	* src/explore: factorisation of the evc build makefiles thanks Michael Fink.

	* src/explore/Makefiles/nmake/lib/clean.mak, macro.mak: Addition of some
	file clean up for the clobber rule thanks Michael Fink.

2004-09-03  Francois Dumont  <dums@...>

	* test/unit/fstream_test.cpp, sstream_test.cpp: Move of the test for the
	infinite loop from FstreamTest test case to SstreamTest, addition of some
	checks.

	* test/unit/full_streambuf.h: streambuf implementation simulating full
	output.

	* stlport/exception: restauration of some modification removed after the
	rollback of the 2004-09-01.

	* stlport/config/stl_gcc.h: homogeneification of the coding standard used
	within STLport, 2 spaces indentations even for preprocessor directives.
	Doing so, discovered a weird configuration for Mac OS platform (__APPLE__)
	concerning the _STLP_NATIVE_INCLUDE_PATH macro definition, fixed.

	* stlport/stl/config/stl_*.mak: removal of all references to the 
	_STLP_REDEFINED_STD macro as it is now the default and only way STLport 
	use to replace native Standard library.

	* test/unit/nmake-vc-common.mak: add inclusion of the vc_warning_disable.h
	file to avoid warnings during build process thanks Michael Fink.

2004-09-03  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr@Island...>

	* stlport/stl/_ostream.c: removed infinite loop in case when outgoing stream
	can't accept more chars. Thanks Daniel White, Ulrich Eckhardt, Francois Dumont.

	* test/unit/fstream_test.cpp: test for problem above. Thanks Ulrich Eckhardt.

2004-09-02  Francois Dumont  <dums@...>

	* stlport/exception, stlport/stl/_site_config.h, test/unit/exception_test.cpp:
	Creation of the _STLP_NO_UNEXPECTED_EXCEPT_SUPPORT macro to signal support of
	the unexpected exception mecanism. Related type/function are only brought to the
	STLport namespace if correctly supported, exception_test.cpp check that.

	* New modification of the _Rb_tree and _Hashtable associated iterator structs.
	Removal of the container_type pass through the iterator traits; iterator traits
	is the type that will make each derived container iterator type real different
	type making them uncomparable.

	* stlport/ctype.h: rollback of the above rollback ;-) only of course for the 
	Win CE code fix that was part of the previous commitment.

2004-09-01  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr@Island...>

	* Rollback include schema: code is broken.

2004-08-31  Francois Dumont  <dums@...>

	* _STLP_INCOMPLETE_EXCEPTION_HEADER replace by the more intuitive
	_STLP_NO_UNCAUGHT_EXCEPT_SUPPORT macro.

	* Modification of the include schema of all public headers in stlport folder
	that need to be reentrant. Now those files are fully guarded and the specific
	STLport code is only included once at the end of the inclusion, the reentrancy
	only concern inclusion of the native headers.

2004-08-30  Francois Dumont  <dums@...>

	* stlport/stl/_deque.c: Fix of a pseudo 'uninitialized variable used' thanks

2004-08-27  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr@Island...>

	* src/explore/Makefiles/gmake/gcc.mak, app/gcc.mak, lib/gcc.mak: buggy C++
	language support in libsupc++ in gcc before 3.3 not allow to use it;
	link with libstdc++ instead.

	uncaught_exception and exception handling in general thanks John Roberts.

	* stlport/stl/_tree.h, _tree.c: Modification of the _Rb_tree_iterator	struct
	to be able to distiguish iterator types from different tree based containers
	Removal of the == and != member operators of the _Rb_tree_base_iterator struct
	replaced by global operators taking _Rb_tree_iterator as parameters and checking
	that the iterators are of the same container type thanks Haroon Nassiry report.
	
	* stlport/stl/_map.h, _set.h: Modification of the iterator traits used to 
	instanciate the _Rb_tree class.
	
	* stlport/stl/_hashtable.h, _hashtable.c, _hash_set.h, _hash_map.h: Similar
	modifications to the previous one in order to make for instance the iterator
	from hash_map and hash_multimap not comparable anymore.
	
	* stlport/config/stl_wince.h, stlport/ctype.h: Move of the isspace C function
	Windows CE specific code from the config file to the ctype.h file. This fix
	will also apply to Embedded C++ .Net thanks Dirk report.

2004-08-23  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr@Island...>

	* test/unit/cppunit/cppunit_proxy.h, test/init/gcc.mak: CPPUNIT_MINI removed.

	* src/num_get_float.cpp: suggestion to fix problem with float input for gcc 3.4.x
	with optimization flag.

	* test/unit/floatio_test.cpp: test for infinity and near

	* src/explore/Makefiles/gmake/gcc.mak, app/gcc.mak, lib/gcc.mak: fix detection of
	gcc version; gcc before 3.x had libgcc.a that contains some language support,
	so link with it in case when we avoid link with libstd++. This has relation only
	for linux systems.

2004-08-19  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr@Island...>

	* src/explore/configure.bat: setting up compiling STLport under Windows.
	Contribution by Michael Fink.

2004-08-13  Francois Dumont  <dums@...>

	* test/unit/gcc.mak: Addition of the _STLP_NO_CUSTOM_IO define to make test
	build faster.

	symbols--partially rollback changes 2004-07-29; add test for possible locale
	init/deinit problem---I don't see problem. Test inspired by Alex Kosilin.

2004-08-11  Francois Dumont  <dums@...>

	* src/explore/Makefiles/nmake: extension of the new build system for VC.Net

	before inclusion as the check is already done to include _string.c from _string.h.

	* stlport/stl/_istream.h _istream.c: removal of the _M_put_num function definition
	from the .h and removal of all the inline implementation of the >> operators.
	_M_put_num is now hidden in the .c to avoid to have to deal with export of this
	symbol. Fix errors while using the _STLP_NO_CUSTOM_IO macro.
	
	* stlport/stl/_ostream.h _ostream.c, src/ostream.cpp: ditto but for the _M_get_num
	function.
	
	* stlport/stl/_istream.h _istream.c: _M_init_skip and _M_init_noskip are now inline
	functions defined within the .h to fix link errors when using the _STLP_NO_CUSTOM_IO
	macro.

2004-08-10  Francois Dumont  <dums@...>

	* stlport/stl/_string.h: add check of the _STLP_EXPOSE_STREAM_IMPLEMENTATION
	macro to include the _string.c file. Improve compile time when _STLP_NO_CUSTOM_IO
	is defined.

	* stlport/stl/_string.h, stlport/stl/debug/_string.h, _string_mem_t.h: restoration
	of the template method specialization for backward compatibility between compilers
	implementating template method and the most recent one. It is considered as an 
	STLport extension.

2004-08-09  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr@Island...>

	* test/compiler: tests to check whether compiler understand or not some
	language construction. It is NOT tests for language support libraries,

	* stlport/config/stl_msvc.h: fix of the config to signal no IEC 559 support before
	Visual C++ .Net even if the infinity value is fine.
	
	* test/unit/limits_test.cpp: New test case to check the right numeric_limits class
	configuration. Do not check the signaling_NaN yet...

	specialization before the explicit instanciation of the basic_ios class for
	the char type.
	
	* stlport/stl/_construct.h, _num_put.c: fix of some unused parameter warning
	thanks Oliver Stoeneberg report.

2004-08-05  Francois Dumont <dums@...>

	test suite.

2004-08-04  Francois Dumont <dums@...>

	* stlport/stl/debug/_list.h, _slist.h: small review of the stlport debug code.

	of some unjustified iterator invalidation.

	* stlport/stl/_locale.h, _collate.h, src/locale.cpp, locale_catalog.cpp, locale_impl.cpp:
	Split of the locale class implementation into _LocaleBase base class with no member
	template methods which is exported and the locale class which is not exported. This
	is a workaround for the MSVC6 compiler.

2004-08-03  Francois Dumont <dums@...>

	* stlport/stl/_iterator.h: Fix of the back_insert_iterator, front_insert_iterator
	and insert_iterator to make them assignable like specify in the Standard requirements

	the assignment operators on the output iterators.

2004-08-02  Francois Dumont <dums@...>

	* stlport/stl/_string.h, _string.c, debug/_string.h: split of the basic_string
	implementation into a class with no member templates and one with the member 
	templates. Only the one with no member templates is exported. This is a MSVC6
	bug workaround as this compiler try to look for the class method symbols within
	the dynamic library even if this symbol is the one of template method which is 
	not exported. That also make the basic_string implementation more clean so it
	has been adopted for all compilers.

2004-07-29  Francois Dumont <dums@...>

	* test/unit/locale_test.cpp: Fix bad macro _STLP_NO_EXCEPTIONS spelling 
	and add of a check for real locale implementation. Patch done by

	inclusion from the .h to the .c that is the only one that need it.

	* stlport/stl/_config.h: addition of the boost support section.

2004-07-07  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr@Island...>

	* stlport/stl/_monetary.c: iterator __str_first out of range,
	i.e. outside __str_last in 'mismatch' call in __get_string, if

	number of element before multiplication with the size of the objects
	to instanciate.

2004-06-22  Francois Dumont  <dums@...>

	* src/locale_catalog.cpp: fix of the locale facets registration system.
	The hash container use string as key rather than char const* so that
	a copy of the facet name is stored rather than a copy of the string
	pointer that might be freed. We also extract the complete facet name
	before storing it to avoid store of facet aliases that cannot be retrieved
	at release.

	or not---of replace function with four iterators in parameters.

	* test/unit/nmake-src-prefix.mak: really know what do with sources
	in cppunit.

2004-03-25  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr@Island...>

	* stlport/stl/_string_base.h: enlarge default string static buffer size

	* stlport/stl/debug/_string.h: avoid attempt to invalidate iterators beyond
	string size range.

	* stlport/config/stl_gcc.h: instantiation scheme that idefault used---witout
	--repo option---in gcc 3 made void of sense explicit instantiation within
	library---nothing except increased library size.
	Define _STLP_NO_FORCE_INSTANTIATE is default now for gcc 3.x.

	* stlport/stl/_streambuf.h: remove specialization of
	basic_streambuf<char, char_traits<char> >---reference to FILE struct here
	isn't required and really not used anyware. Functionality of standard io
	streams, including synchronization with C std io streams provided in
	src/stdio_streambuf.cpp

	* stlport/stl/_iosfwd.h: same.

	* src/fstream_impl.h, src/iostream.cpp, src/stdio_streambuf.cpp: same.
	
	* src/streambuf.cpp: removed.

	* stlport/stl/_stdio_file.h: moved...
	* src/_stdio_file.h: ...here

	* stlport/stdio_streambuf: moved...
	* src/_stdio_file.h: ...here

	* src/explore/Makefile.inc: remove streambuf.cpp

2004-03-24  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr@Island...>

	the stlport prolog/epilog include framework.

2004-02-19  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr@Island...>

	* _slist.h, debug/_slist.h,, dll_main.cpp: remove excess slist redefinitions

	* debug/_slist.h: comment explicit usage of namespace with functions---under
	some conditions this hangs gcc compilers.

	* _config.h, _cwchar.h, _epilog.h, _iterator_base.h, debug/_debug.c: multiple import
	of _STL namespace into std, as multiple import VENDOR_CSTD namespace into _STL
	namespace lead to crash of gcc compilers. Import of _STL namespace into std
	namespace done once in the _config.h, not in _epilog.h.

	* _prolog.h: undef std not required in all cases; instead this is useful only
	for redefinition of std namespace, and should be done in the _config.h.

	* _epilog.h: include of _config.h has no sense here.

	* _threads.h: wrong import of _STL namespace into global namespace

2004-02-18  Francois Dumont <dums@s...>

	* _list.h: Modification of the base list class based on the slist implementation.

	on Linux.

2004-02-05  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr@Island...>

	* iostream.cpp, _ios_base.h, iostream, locale_impl.h, locale_impl.cpp:
	revise standard iostream and locale initialization, remove worrits about
	order of static objects initialization as soon as possible; all real
	initialization situated in the locale_impl.cpp; locale initialization
	moved to _Locale_impl constructor---locale will be correctly initialized
	either via direct locale usage, or during standard iostream initialization,
	as ios_base member. This changes may lead to problems with Digital Mars
	and Borland compilers---should be checked and fixed.

2004-02-03  Francois Dumont <dums@s...>

	mode.

2004-01-29  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr@Island...>

	* _string.c: avoid 'insert( iterator, const_iterator, const_iterator )'

	copy thanks Sergey Volk

2004-01-19  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr@Island...>

	* _debug.c: avoid recursive locks in __owner_list's mutex---equivalent
	code use underlie iterators, not debug wrapper iterators. By the way this
	approach faster---no excessive checks; solved by Boris Fomitchev.

	* _thread.h, _debug.h: recursive-safe mutex structure removed---not
	required more; see reason just above.

2004-01-09  Francois Dumont <dums@s...>

	class members in debug wrapper.

2003-12-22  Francois Dumont  <dums@s...>

	* _string.h: use _STLP_FORCE_STRING_TERMINATION flag to enforce
	null-termination of data associated with string.
 
2003-12-20  Francois Dumont  <dums@s...>

	return type; this occur	when dereference return some proxy object,
	convertible into value type.
	Thanks Przemek Kuczmierczyk <przemekk834@tlen.pl> for report, test
	and solution.

	* iterswp0.cpp, iterswp1.cpp, iterswp.cpp, stl_test.cpp,
	stl_test.h, Makefile.inc (test/regression): move iterswp0_test,
	iterswp1_test into iterswp.cpp, add new tests for properly deduce
	value type of iterator, when dereference return some proxy object.

2003-11-15  Francois Dumont  <dums@s...>

	* _string.h: implementation of the expression template for string
	addition with other string or C string or char.

	* "prepare" target added to all makefiles in src/; should be run before using STLport;
	  on most platforms it's empty, on some of them it creates necessary symbolic links, etc.
	
	* stl/_deque.h : deque<>::erase bug (introduced in 4.1b4) fixed (thanks to BruceFlorman)

The following changes were made in 4.1 beta 4 since 4.1 beta 3 :
	
	* Simulation of class partial specialization (thanks to  Mat Marcus and Jesse Jones of Adobe)
	  used to provide following enhancements :
	
	 - type_traits are automatically specialized for all pointer types for all compilers, 
	   which makes them able to utilize type_traits-based optimizations when dealing with pointer types, 
	   automatically.
	
	 - all functions specialized for pointers and optimized via __type_traits
	   ( like copy()/copy_backward(), _uninitialized_xx) now enjoy this optimization for all compilers!
        
	- generic __value_type()/__difference_type()/__iterator_category() are written so user does not have
	   to supply any of its own even when partial specialization is not available.
	   (Note : gcc-2.7 and VC++ 5.x, 6.x have bugs which prevents them from using this enhancement, still)
	
	* <iterator> : by default, non-standard iterator query names like 
	  value_type()/difference_type()/iterator_category() are not used
	
	* <algo> : major revision:
	   - algorithms without explicit Compare() function expressed via the one that has it where possible.
	     This considerably reduces header size and reduces code bloat for programs which use both flavours of
	     those algorithms.
	   - some function bodies moved between  .c and .h 
	   - all functions used internally moved out to _algobase.h, so no other header includes <_algo.h> anymore
	   - find() specialized for random access iterators regardless of partial spec.

	* Dynamic libraries (.DLL and .so) : name versioning used to prevent clashes between STLport versions

	* src/ : code regrouped between .cpp files to provide for less executable size with dumb linkers;

	* locale subsystem initialization : startup changed to use statically allocated structures as much as possible;
	
	* <stl/_function.h> : basic stuff moved to _function_base.h ; 
	  other STL headers now include _function_base.h instead

	* _threads.h : MT support for OS/2 added (only tested with VAC++)

	* _stdio_file.h : added support for Solaris in ELF64 mode (thanks to Holger Stasch)
	
	* stl/_hashtable.h : [] operator for hash_map optimized to take no more than find() when element is present
	  (Thanks to Thomas Witt et al.)

	* _ostream.h : fix for default unsigned char (thanks to  Holger Stasch)
	
	* all __STL_ABBREVS abbreviations moved aside in _abbrevs.h header.

	* Fujitsu C++ Compiler support added (thanks to  Holger Stasch)
	
	* Initial SGI iostreams port to OS/390 introduced (thanks to  Holger Stasch).

	* _bitset.h - member workaround operators made const (thanks to dzwick) 

	* _bitset.h/.c, hashtable.h -- small bugfixes (thanks to Levente Farkas)
	
	* <exception> - now includes exception.h if only that is available.

	* vector::assign() inplemented for vector::iterator when member templates are not available (Thanks to dzwick)

	* fstream.cpp : __pioinfo used for MinGW32 (thanks to Danny Smith)
	
The following changes were made in 4.1 beta 3 since 4.1 beta 2 :

	* list<>::clear() : protected access bug fixed

	* __STL_MUTEX_INITIALIZER set back to PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER for pthreads case, 
	  as some platforms (eg AIX) do not treat zero-initialized mutex as valid one (thanks to Alex Vanic, Jack Andrews for help)
	
	* stl/_limits.c : fixed typo preventing numeric limits constants to be defined for __STL_LITTLE_ENDIAN,
	  constants initialization fixed (thanks to Ingo Donasch)  

	* real implementation of locales for Win32 contributed by Anton Lapach (thanks !) merged in.
	
	* stl_user_config.h, _config.h : changed default to not define relops:: operators
	  in __STL_NO_NAMESPACES mode.

	* _numeric_facets.c/num_put.cpp : printing of integer do not use sprintf() anymore

	* "install" target implemented for UNIX & VC++ Makefiles. It now installs headers and libraries.

	* "src" : files merged to get less compilation time and less space overhead for imperfect compilers

	* "debug" flavour of STLport excluded from default build and auto-select ; 
	  please use __STL_USE_DEBUG_LIB and build debug STLport lib explicitly with "make debug_dynamic" 
	  if you really need it). "all" now builds 2 kinds : "release" and "STLdebug", for static and dynamic builds.  

	* stlport_prefix.h : WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN set for Win32 build of STLport library, for speed.

	* FreeBSD compile fixed; makefiles added.

	* All "__init" changed to "_Init" to fix clashes with DEC conventions (thanks to Holger Stasch)
