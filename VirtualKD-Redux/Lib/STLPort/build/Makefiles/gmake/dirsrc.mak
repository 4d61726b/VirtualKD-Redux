# Some trick to build implicit rules for sources in some different
# subdirectories. I remove catalogs from path to sources, with this
# names I build output object path, and provide dependency from
# source in directory. Due to no loops for rules definition, I should
# use recursion here;

# try take directory from list:
WORD1 := $(word 1,$(DIRS_UNIQUE_SRC))

# is still directory in the list?
ifneq "$(WORD1)" ""

include ${RULESBASE}/rules-res.mak
endif
ifeq ($(OSNAME),windows)

# remove processed directory from list
DIRS_UNIQUE_SRC := $(filter-out $(WORD1),$(DIRS_UNIQUE_SRC))
# recursive include here:
