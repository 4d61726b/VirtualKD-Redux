The cygwin platform is used to build STLport with different compilers.

- gcc (native compiler):

  Makefile : gcc.mak

    WARNING : If you use the static version of the STLport
  libraries you have to define the _STLP_USE_STATIC_LIB
  macro in order to have your executable linked correctly.

    To build STLport libraries that do not depend on cygwin1.dll
  making them freely redistributable use the --no-cygwin configuration
  option.

- Borland C++ compiler
